"As a compnay we supply services to property managers but they need the invoice to go directly to their landlords, to have to create multiple contacts for all the individual properties for the same client would be really complicated and would mean we don't have a proper history for the client as all invoices would be spread across multiple contacts.",2

This is not necessarily what I require....Multiple addresses etc.

"I personally think that Xero needs to add additional fields on the invoice template so you can manually input delivery addresses. 

Some businesses work with multiple customers per day, but on a Cash basis and don't necessarily want to create a contact for each of the customers. So the ability to create a CASH Contact to invoice these clients on, and just add the delivery address and additional billing details if required would be great.

Like Pastel. 
",2
"We also require something along these lines i.e. the ability to assign an individual in an organisation to a department such as, the PO contact, the accounts contact, the sales contact etc. So the system is intelligent enough to know when you are sending a PO, which emails to send it to and so on. 

We have to essentially add the contact details right now, select include in emails and then try to remember who POs go to, who invoices go to and delete the unnecessary email addresses. Pretty tedious.",1

Can you please respond to the requests of users to have notifications for payments. When a payment is received an alert, ideally email, is sent to the user.

Being able to create your own field in contacts would be great!  We pay a lot of our vendors by Zelle and would like to keep their email or phone # that is connected to their zelle account which maybe different than their business email or phone #.

We currently have to put these address into Xero as a Item so that the information as already in the system and data entry mistakes aren't made but it is a bit crazy esp when the rudimentary Xero reports will include the Item in reports that then make the report meaningless or just inaccurate for mamangement information.

"could we have a customer address and then an invoice address and delivery address all seperate and all easily seen on one page and easy to edit - what you have is rubbish and does not work for me easily.

Agree with Benjamin on 16.08.22 - this is such a basic feature. Time to move a batch of clients back to Sage - hugely embarrassing and a complete waste of time.,0
"@Benjamin Patton - this has actually been a feature request for around 7 to 9 years..... they closed their old forum and created this one, so all of the requests that have been around for years now look new.

"Thanks to the wayback machine, we can see that the same thread on the old forum was started in 2012. It had 679 votes and 701 replies.

So I wouldn't hold your breath 😐

This is incredibly important - we have many customers with multiple service locations and some of these customers won't accept Xero invoices due to the fact we can't show the service location address on the invoice unless we update it on the system every single time which is time consuming when Xero is supposed to be making our lives easier!,0
"WAY TO GO XERO......

Instead of fixing this issue, you have changed the way that you update client details.  Instead of amending client postal address, physical address and phone number etc on the one screen, lets put in a process that takes three times as long as you have to go into three different screens to update this information.

Why do your programmers insist on creating more problems instead of fixing that ones that we have been asking for for over 10 years......

"Hi all

We've been using a work around by changing the delivery address for accounts to match their requirements. As we add more customers, many larger than we've traditionally dealt with, this is becoming a complicated and time consuming task. Example 1 - Company group structure with single billing address and multiple manufacturing sites. Example 2 - Customer is a distributor who wants us to drop-ship orders to their various customers. Example 3 - Single company with various departments, each with individual delivery addresses.

I'm amazed when I read others' comments that this request has been pushed to one side for so long. C'mon Xero - this should be a basic feature.",1

"Hi Kelly, any update on this? 

Our current work around to deal with multiple delivery addresses is very time consuming especially now with the new Contact layout and tabs. 

Double checking all the right info has been entered for a contact is also a hassle now with all the different tabs. 

Can Xero please go back to the old 'Contact' layout on the one page and have the ability to add multiple delivery addresses before we have to jump ship.",2
We have numerous solicitor's companies which have the same name but different addresses but under the new set up if we already have e.g Fred Blogs and Co in it will not allow us to add another fred bloggs and co with a different address - very annoying and inconvenient.

"Personally can't believe this functionality hasn't been created given the amount of businesses that have multiple shipments locations for the same business.

customers want a statement for all stores combined and to manually type in an address each invoice just show PO's can be matched and paid is silly. Given Xero generally improves efficiency though automation rather than manual entry",1
"A few clients need this , one reason the won’t come to xero ",1
It's frustrating when dealing with multiple contracts and departments within the same company.  Currently each contract with the same client is set up with a new debtor record with new contact details.  It makes reporting time consuming if you have to go through and add them all together to get anything meaningful around your debtors.  Other software packages can deal with it - how do they do it?  I appreciate your time in looking into this.,1
Many customers have multiple shipping addresses. It's very annoying that these cannot be stored so you can choose the shipping address for a particular order. I know that Sage allows for this and it seems crazy Xero as advanced as it is does not. Please sort it out Xero. All I can do currently is save the addresses previously used under notes for the customer.,1
"Multiple delivery points are very common and having just moved from a competitor a single delivery point in addition to the billing address is very inconvenient.
As Xero expands its customer base there will be an increasing need for multiple delivery addresses, it should not be delayed.",2

I have been waiting for this feature since it was first requested in 2012..... don't hold your breath......,0
"Hello Kelly,

This feature was requested over ten years ago. The recent ""upgrades"" to contacts has actually made contacts more time consuming, confusing, and difficult to use. It would be great if Xero could continue to move in the direction of making the product better without making it more difficult to use in the process.

We have multiple delivery addresses for each customer so this would be very useful as at the moment we have to re-enter the delivery address everytime we raise a new invoice,2
Data Relationship 101 - create 1 company (type = Customer or Supplier) with many contact records allowed,2
This is a much needed feature.  We often have once finance company that we need to bill but for multiple customers and delivery details.,2
"Recently discovered this issue as we have been asked to provide services to multiple sites for an international group with one invoicing address. Yes, documents can be manually adjusted to reflect the site where the services were delivered but shouldn't have to do it that way. Especially considering one of the reasons for selecting Xero from the start was the ability to create branded document templates.",2
"I've just had a customer question an invoice reminder as it had the incorrect delivery address on it. This is a direct result of having only one delivery address per contact. The original invoice was sent out with the correct delivery address, but we then had to change the address to accommodate the next order. The invoice reminders default to the current delivery address not the original. So what I thought was an inconvenient but doable work-around doesn't really work after all. Once more, I implore Xero to take the request for multiple delivery addresses per contact seriously and put some resource behind fixing it.",1
I have contacts with more than 5 addresses! Please add this feature!,2
It's very basic and much needed features!,1
"Very disappointed after been sold Xero as very intuitive and easy software and turns out that one of the most basic fields on invoicing is not been implemented from the start. I cannot believe that every time we have to resend invoices we have to type manually the delivery address and save it in the pc doubling the work and making other functionalities on Xero worthless. 

This is a very basic functionality and the fact that changes the invoice details based on the contact address is just very poor.

I hope you can resolve this very soon as I can see people are been asking for a few years already and nothing is been done yet.

"Hi Kelly Munro,

Why the delivery address has to rely on contact data? Why not creating an additional field in the invoice page and the delivery address gets linked into each individual invoice like other fields (Reference, items, description of goods,....) That way the invoices won't change. 

I am sure that won't take too long to implement...

"What Toni is suggesting below is exactly what we are looking for as well. If the address could be tied to the individual invoice rather than the client level, that would solve many of the issues we are having. As others noted, it causes issues when needing to resend the invoice and/or send invoice reminders if the invoice address is different from what's under the contact defaults. ",2
"When viewing invoices that have been entered using ""new invoicing"", it would be extremely useful to have the Delivery Address appear on the New Invoice Screen in a similar manner to New Bill Screen.

This is a must. We have clients with different contacts for different branches. Also more than 2 addresses are required.,2
"This is a major flaw in Xero, that when you edit the delivery address for a contact that it changes the address when the client uses the link for all previous invoices.

As far as i can see nothing has been done for this to be actioned. 
Xero team please correct me if I am wrong.

In my frustrations with this i have been following closely what changes have been made and in my opinion the only changes that have been made are for the Accounting / Tax side of the software.

As many of you will probably agree we moved from a competitor (that did allow multiple delivery addresses) on the advise of our Accountants ... 

Therefor all i can suggest is what i am doing and putting pressure back on my Accountants to send requests to Xero to get this changed or at least a seriously high priority on this matter.

"I think xero is overthinking this.  The way it works in quickbooks and others is you can freeform paste in a shipping address during invoice creating.  Since our clients jobs (contruction) go from address to address, it is not important to keep this info in a record beyond just the invoice.

Let me repeat: we have customers where the shipping invoice is NEVER the same and it changes EVERY bill.

What most people are doing now in xero is adding it to the reference field or pasting in a ""freight"" item line.  So why not just have an optionally-filled ship to line that can be pasted into as customers are already doing with these workarounds??",0
"We just want to be able to add multiple contact email addresses for a single customer- so accounts@ then john.smith@ and sales@ purchasing@, so that it's easy to contact a specific person when required. I cannot believe that something that a basic Sage package which I previously used for almost 20 years, had the ability to do this, but Xero doesn't.",1
"So by now, you will all have received a message from the new CEO at Xero, Sukhinder, in which she suggested that if anyone had an issue that they thought would merit her personal attention, they should write to her directly.
So I did, regarding the (lack of) progress and communication on the issue of multiple delivery addresses (about which some 417 of us have now written). The reply I received is below.
Given that I was actually complaining about the people who deal with (ignore) issues sent through Xero central / product ideas - I am now waiting for a reply from.... (drumroll).... the very people who I was complaining about - who continue to ignore me, because, despite another week passing I have not received a reply.

Thanks for reaching out to ceo@xero.com - I love hearing from you and getting your feedback.

Emails to this inbox will be monitored by the Xero team and we’ll do our best to respond where possible.

If you have a support query, please continue to reach out via Xero Central. For all feature requests and product ideas, please go to Xero Product Ideas.

Best wishes,

For anyone interested - the transcript of my e-mail is below

This is not customer service - it's rudeness.

--------8<------
May I take the opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment and thank you for your introductory e-mail, which has arrived at a particularly opportune moment as I have become increasingly frustrated with the lack of feedback and basic customer service from Xero over recent months. 
Writing comments and suggestions via Xero Central seems to be like shouting into a void. One particular issue that has been ongoing for almost a year now concerns the facility (or rather the current lack of it) for multiple delivery addresses to be stored for each contact, a facility supported now by over 400 of your clients. If you look at the timeline, there has been only one response from Xero (in September 2022) in which we were all told by Kelly Munro that Xero were working hard behind the scenes…. but nothing since. Having posted to the forum again in January and still not received a reply, I took to Twitter as follows:    
  @Xero
still no update on multiple delivery address capability - ongoing for a year. 400 of your users have told you this is crucial, but no comment from Xero since 11 Sep 2022. Ignoring your customers is never a good idea.
Replying to 
@graham_tottle
@graham_tottle
Thanks for the prompt and feedback. We're not ignoring you ... there is no further update. Per the post from us in September, we're undertaking work behind the scenes which will allow us to more easily add new features and ideas like this. ^OG

From a customer’s point of view, these replies are somewhat condescending and patronising. It is unacceptable to be “kept in the dark” in this way with no timescale for Beta testing or implementation mentioned. To be told that “it’s complicated and we are working on it” is just not good enough.  I believe that we are entitled to expect better.

Please upgrade this asap!! If the technology needs upgrading for such a simple feature then this should be priority otherwise how else will anything be upgraded. Really considering moving to MYOB...,0
Thank you for the update Kelly! Can't wait to see how the feature functions.,4
"Hope to see the solution live soon. It's a common feature in all software.
Thank you for your speedily work on it to solve it.

Thank you",4
"I first commented on this thread about the need for the ability to assign multiple prices for a product across different customers. 
I have one product that 10 customers use - I have had to create 10 different product codes in order to have that price available on the system, even though its the same product.
e.g A price for Customer 'A', I have code 9999A for $xx 
Customer B has a different price, so I have code 9999B - the exact same product but now with Price $yy
To work out how many of product 9999 I've actually sold in total I need to export to Excel and run formulas.
I have 65 different products I am doing this with - we're up to about 4000 codes to cover it all.

This thread seems to have morphed into multiple addresses per customers.
We need both!",2
Thank you for the update Kelly as we are needing this feature for our business. It would be good if the multiple delivery address synced with Workflowmax too.,3
"This has taken some time, it would also be good to have an option for landlord option, for example mr Jones owns 3 apartments 2 house, he can be involved for all service charge for these instead of having multiple customer. ",2
"Desperate for this to become a feature. I have mainly corporates with various clients inside those corporates to deal with. I can't set each up as a client.

They all have the same billing details, but different areas within the business.

So COMPANY > Client 1; Client 2; Client 3; etc

Please make this happen.

Thanks!",2
"I can see you can add a contact and then add this contact to a group, but this will lead to thousands of contacts which will only be used once.
We have all estate invoices in a group called ""Customer Invoices"" but then each invoice will be addressed to different customers/estates/executors so we cannot build this data in a generic template.
Is there a function to have the ""Customer Invoice"" template include a box where you can manually add the individual customer data such as name and address on raising the invoice so we can eliminate the need to add a contact each time that will never be used again.",2
"Need to add in a ""Shipping address"" field at invoice template for user to input to solve this problem, is rather common in other software. not at the contact area.",2

"Ability to add multiple custom fields in general is much needed. With ability for them to be used in the templates.

"Currently on Page 5 of this idea Xero said this...

Xero Team (Admin, Xero) commented
Ability to add delivery address to quote/invoices.
Purpose: To save time from having to edit a contact to add a street address.

I think this proves that Xero is made by accountants for accountants. Although they don't seem to have much of a concept for what a legal entity is, or how businesses actually work, where products and services can be delivered to more than one address.

Anyway I'll wait another couple of years to see if this progresses any further.",1
"Hi Xero,
Please add field for ""delivery address"" and ""customer PO number""  when preparing Invoice with ability in the template. Nothing to do with contact.",2
"Example : I sell goods to ""ABC"" company but to delivery to their customers all over the place. so I have to create an invoice to bill them and show them where i delivered to. no need to add delivery adddress into contact,  just save in that particular invoice",2
"Any update ????????

",1
"As a sub-contractor for construction companies, we are dealing with various people within that company - accounts, estimators, foremans, owners etc. As an quick fix, we are already capturing if the contact is to be included in emails - can this be expanded to display all contacts for the company in the drop down list when preparing an invoice, quote etc? 

Ideally, long term fix would be when creating a contact for the same company, we have the functionality to select emails to be included on - sales, bills etc. Then when preparing a quote or invoice all of the contacts for that company (filtered by contact email type) would be displayed in the drop down list and the user can select the appropriate contact(s). 

As a workaround - I have to add all contacts to receive emails and then manually delete those that aren't to receive the quote or invoice prior to sending. Using attached example, the contact for persontwo@test.com would also appear for this company ABC...and provide me with the ability to select either or both to receive this invoice.",2
"Is there any update on this please? I have a client wanting to change software but they won't use Xero unless this key feature is in place. They're looking at other software options, so I just wanted to check whether timescales are known before they look to commit elsewhere? Thanks.",1
Dear Xero. You may or may not be aware that Quickbooks Desktop is being discontinued on 30th June this year. Not having a different delivery address or multiple address options will be a deal breaker for many and they will choose other software over Xero.,1
Are Xero any further forward with this as it appears that this idea was started back in 2012 (11 years ago)?,1
"We deal with several large companies. Invoices will go out to the same company BUT with contact1+address1, contact2+address1 and contact2/address2, etc.
It is unclear to me if the brief description of the 'idea' will achieve what we need.
The irony is MYOB allowed us to do that but we believed all the marketing hype about Xero and changed. We deeply regret that change and either Xero invests in improving the product to service the businesses you advertise to or we will be switching back.",1
"Surely you have this sorted by now? Will need to move platform if it's not soon.
Can't thin why it's not complete considering other platforms have had it as staple for years.",0
"A year on - nearly 500  clients crying out for a solution and still nothing from Xero.
This feature (multiple delivery addresses) already exists in the Purchase Order screen, so it should be relatively straightforward to enable something similar for invoicing (if of course there is a will to do it.....) 
Shockingly slow effort from Xero. ",0
"Agreed with Graham Tottle
Don't Understand why just can't add in this simple yet important feature into invoice template. ",1
"I cannot believe this feature is still not live!  We got suckered in by the marketing claims from Xero and our so called advisor, and are actively looking to change.  Xero does not care about implementing multiple contacts, as long as people are still paying!!",0
Came here hoping that there would be a solution to this seemingly simple request. Looks like I am out of luck. How hard can it be to add a drop down box within a customer record to choose different FAO details!,0
I've given up waiting. Going with a different provider for me and my 80+ clients books. Too bad such a straight forward and every-day need was not deisgned in the orginal build or updated after they were notified of this significant deficiency.,0
"many of our customers are large organizations (like universities). While all the bills for invoices to different departments are paid by the university, we invoice the individual departments separately, and they all have separate contact information (emails, phone, mailing addresses). 

In Quickbooks, we used ""Jobs"" (which are basically folders inside the customer), for each department. Each Job could have its own contact info. Something like that would be welcome. As it is now, we have to have 22 separate customers just for one university, because that's how many departments we work with. Even though the checks for all of those come from the same place. ",2
We need the ability to have multiple contacts for and existing Client. The  purpose is to be able to send quotes to different project managers working for the same company.,2
"I agree, I am now creating a pdf of the invoice and manually emailing the invoice, this shouldn't be necessary.",1
"Hi Kelly, it's great you are working on this. 

I'm frustrated by the restriction of address fields to 2 only.

Below is my recent email to your support team.

We have many customers with more than 2 addresses, as below

1) Shop address
2) warehouse address
3) Billing address

However we are only able to add 2 addresses to the Contact Details page, which means valuable information is missing from their Contact records.

Can you please add an extra address field into the Contact Details Section?",3
"I cannot believe this function is not available. I also regret following the advice of our accountants to switch to Xero. Should have stuck with Quick Books as their  Customer 'Jobs' for those repeat customers with different delivery addresses worked perfectly.
Feeling very frustrated right now.",1
"Hi Kelly, any update?  As other posters point out, Sage and QuickBooks have this basic feature as standard.  Regrettably, I'm at the point now where I feel there is no alternative other than to move clients off Xero and back to Sage/QB. ",1
I'm still waiting for this after it was first requested about 10 years ago (in the old version of the portal).......,1
"Yep requested along with 1000 other things (all about 5 to 10 years ago on the old ideas and comments system they conveniently removed) that would have made Xero the best in the market - but they know best.

It's telling that the last update from Xero was March 06, 2023.

We're talking about ""Ability to create and save multiple addresses for a single contact record""

"We have about 10 clients that would love to get off of Quickbooks...and on to Xero.  But Xero does not listen to the clients needs.  This feature is a basic requirement for most companies doing B2B transactions.

There are other request we have posted and they are being ignored by Xero development team.  How long will it take to implement those basic ideas.  I guess Xero does not want to improve their software.  What a waste of .... talent, time, money....everything about on this software. 

Mean-time we are on the sidelines..... waiting!",0
"If its been in the pipeline for some where between 5 and10yrs as mentioned previously, then there is a strong chance that it will never be actioned!  ",1
"Wow, can't believe how long some of you have been waiting for this fix!",1
"This is a huge shortcoming in Xero, there is no logical reason to not have this feature enabled prior to offering accounting software of this calibre. Kelly, any chance you could give a finite date as to when this basic feature will be live?",0
"I've had to create separate contacts for each Defence contract manager, because of this. There's a lot of them. Each invoice has to be CC'd to the correct contact when you send it to Defence accounts, and I'm not willing to bet on my ability to not make typos when changing things repeatedly, so multiple unnecessary contacts it is...",2
"This feature request has been ongoing since 2012. During this period, Xero removed the original dates from the discussion thread, and to make matters worse, they also deleted the original comments on this new ""Products Idea"" forum. Unfortunately, my comment is missing, so I'm reposting it here.

The issue is that if you do work for a big organisation with hundreds of employees and you are running multiple projects you can't invoice individual people or departments under the same organisation. I know you can add extra contacts but this still doesn't work, as I need the statements generated to ONLY include projects to that relevant team member.

I have resorted to fudging the company name by adding periods in various locations, for example:

Business Name PM Pty Ltd
Business Name PM Pty Ltd.
Business Name PM Pty. Ltd
Business Name PM Pty. Ltd.
Business Name PM. Pty Ltd
Business Name PM. Pty Ltd.
Business Name PM. Pty. Ltd.
Business Name. PM Pty Ltd

This is NOT a very elegant way of managing it and I have also run out of options!

Xero please advise if you are listening to your customers and if this will ever make it onto your roadmap.",0
"Reading Michelle Flynn's comments below fills me with anger. OMG. Such a simple yet essential feature is not being implement and clients are simply ignored.
We are going back to MYOB come 1 July 2023. I've had enough!

And Kelly Monroe - Xero Community Manager - how about giving us an implementation date?",0
"Reading over these comments is laughable. How is adding an extra contact field taking months and months. Xero could easily be the number one option in the accounting software space, but missing some very basic options holds it back. Such a shame.",0

Please remember to bring this up with Xero on Twitter and reference this thread when you do. I'm sure they appreciate the reminders,1
"This is an example of a platform development/services company that, up until recently, had the same issue as Xero does with regards to a lack of updates on most requested features like this one.

Seriously, I've reached a juncture that - without this feature - I'm going to need to migrate to a different platform.

An update, even if progress has been slow, is better than the radio silence we're been subjected to. And the great part? It'd be super easy to make happen with how engaged you are on your Twitter profile, and doesn't need massive capital or a budget to make happen.

You could say it'd cost you $0.00 to, ultimately, do right on your user base.

"Hi Kim,

Well the thread started in 2022 and I believe there have been 2 updates from Xero staff since. 

What you may not be aware of is the fact there used to be another system for ideas and reporting issues - that was ""wiped"" (sorry archived) due to the 3 or 4+ years of comments and ideas that were never actioned.

So in short - don't hold your breath.

I honestly believe a very high proportion of users (30% +) are seriously just waiting for a better online option that has the features of Xero - but actually cares about their paying customers.",1
"Completely agree with Kim and William on this one - the deafening silence from Xero is shocking. I note that after a few adverse comments on another issue (Show contacts on one page) the thread was ""closed"" recently - Xero said contributors were going off topic.... so I suspect the same will happen to this one shortly too. The new CEO (Sukhinder Singh Cassidy) promised more openness but when I wrote to her, I received a message back from her ""team"" (the people I was complaining about) repeating the same old platitudes, before presumably sending my comments to the recycling bin.
This feature (multiple delivery addresses) already exists as a feature on the Purchase Order screen, so it can't be difficult to implement, I am therefore left with no other option but to conclude that Xero don't want to do it for some reason and are not being honest in their (2) replies? Perhaps they are looking at a ""cost v benefit"" analysis that tells them they won't lose too many clients by not doing anything so it won't affect their bottom line too much - or am I being too cynical? Either way, I won't be recommending Xero to anyone until the situation changes for the better and as soon as practical will be moving to another platform with better customer service.
Sukhinder needs to get across this - I don't think they realise how angry their clients are about being fobbed off, patronised and ignored in this way.",0

Xero seem to be very good at implementing changes that have a negative impact  but might in their opinion make it look prettier and have more white space but all these changes are not adding function and value and the ideas posted here that are so heavily positively supported are continually ignored.  The last update on this from Kelly was in March 2023 so five months on this is still outstanding.  We too have stopped recommending Xero and are actively looking for an alternative.",0

I've been waiting for this update in Xero for almost 10 years (my boss won't let me move to a different programme - long story).

"Heartily agree with all the comments about the appalling lack of action and response from Xero on this issue.  Changed to Xero this year believing we were moving to an innovative company with great customer service.  Saw this wasn't avail but was referred to this site about the time Kelly made her last update and mistakenly thought it was all in hand and would be dealt with soon.

Unfortunately I can now see that's not the case, and would definitely not recommend Xero to anyone, the customer service is worse than the company we came from and that's saying a lot!!!

It's such a drama to do basic tasks that are readily avail in other systems and constantly feel unprofessional in having to do things in ad hoc ways just to get what we need from the system.

If anyone discovers a good alternative please let us all know!!!",0

"Hi Muriel,

Don't hold your breath on getting an update from Kelly or anyone else at Xero on this.

The original request is OVER 10 YEARS OLD. It seems Xero is more interested in changing features that used to work to features that now require multiple clicks in multiple pop-ups to complete the work that could be done with one or two clicks in two screens previously.

Our work around is to create a separate account for each address we service for the same company. But you can't use the same account name more than once, so we add the number of the street address after the business name for each separate service address; NSW Realty 45, NSW Realty 903B, etc.

Good luck!

"I thought I would add a bit of technical information, as I have developed applications and databases in the past.

A common flaw when people create contact tables is to restrict the number of addresses that can be added to a contact, by putting that information in the same table. If they used a separate table for addresses (as I believe they do for phone numbers, as you can add multiple ones), then this would be somewhat easier to implement the request. I know, because that is how I do it in my programs.

Unfortunately, if this decision is incorrectly made at the beginning of the database design, then it becomes incredibly difficult the make the change, as you have to update so much stuff to change it (queries and procedures). It is not insignificant. So, unfortunately, I doubt that they will do anything about this.",1

Zero will never update anything.... We have learned by just watching the pain other Zero users are going thru.  We advise our client to beware of this solution for it is not for everyone.,1
"We supply a number of organisations such as care home groups and retail outlets that are billed centrally but have multiple delivery points, at the moment there is only the facility to have one delivery address per billing address.

May stop us converting to Xero",1
"@Kelly Munro - your last post is six months old.  Can we please have an update on the progress?   I realise it's complex, however as you can see, there are a lot of comments so a lot of people are interested in this requirement.",1

"Do you have any update on this at all please, as it's been a long old while since last one?

This is a pretty critical function, which seems to be available in most competitor products.

We sell to a number of clients who need delivery to many different end customers each, so without this function we are having to make use of a number of frustrating workarounds.

Please update.",1
"Also NEED this feature. Please add ASAP, Xero. Thanks!",3
I have looked back and this was first raised 11years ago!! It now has 823 votes! I have to ask what is the point of users asking for the functionality they need if it is going to be ignored? It seems to me that Xero does more tinkering with the look and feel than improving functionality.,1
"100% agree with Roy Brown.
All this tinkering is not necessary.
Add some worthwile content as has been requested by many people and do it soon and keep it comming.
Thats what we are looking for.",1

"Xero's attitude to this ""issue"" is nothing short of contemptuous to its clients. The feature (to add different delivery addresses) exists in the Purchase Order screen, so the code is already written - why can't this be applied to the invoice page too?

Time is running out for Xero as far as many users are concerned.   ",1
@Graham .. hear hear!,2
I see the flashy ads and advertising at sporting events and think if Xero only spent more money on basic product features they would get so many more customers just by 'word of mouth'. Currently I advise any business contacts I have to avoid Xero like the plague. :-(,0
"An additional complication that not having multiple ship to addresses for each customer causes: if I change the delivery address for a different job site for an existing customer in order to have the invoice be correct, it changes all invoices prior to this one to match the change. So there is no way to track where an item was shipped unless we record it somewhere outside of Xero. Even just the step of keeping invoices intact as they were when created would be helpful!",2
"Hi Kelly checking to see status update for this query.
Eight months since last update; i am being optimistic it must surely be ready for release, hoping it was in the November quarterly update.

Can we get an update on this please; I have clients wanting to leave Xero due to this issue.
When is it likely to be release?

"Hi Kelly,

I can't believe how this thread has been ignored by Xero for so long. Bad news is better than no news. 

Please provide a timeframe (not another ""we are working on it"") about Xero's plans for this feature. If it is not going to be implemented, just let us know. 

Thank you",1
This is absolutely critical to the functionality of our invoicing system. Brokers represent our product so we are billing them but shipping products all over North America to hundreds of different delivery address.,1

As I have it, and I picked this up on another Xero ""problem"" forum is that Xero is built on a very outdated ""backbone"" so to speak.
Any changes with Xero concerning direct application changes (not visual) to the application itself is very costly and they might not have the knowledge on how to implement it. That is why at every quarterly Xero update session, most if not all of the updates will be visual aspects e.g. how a report looks like, how many columns you can add etc. Basically taking info of forefront and present it in a different way.
If this issue of multiple contact addresses is so critical to your organisation or your clients', you have 2 options.
1 - contact Xero support directly or 1.1 take it up with your national representative and if not anything is done
2 - advise your clients to break away from Xero.
These 2 options is what I implemented option 2 always sufficed.

This issue is coming very close to being 3 year old !!!   No real progress from Xero other than tissue thin lame platitudes.,1
"Nah not 3 years. I requested this back 10 years ago minimum. They just keep changing the forums and merging and changing the date so it doesn't look like it's been so long. The old threads on this topic had 100s of replies if not more that were ""lost"".",0

"We are unable to know by looking at an invocie which company location a shipment was sent to (most of our customers have multiple facilities), because every time we change the address in the company settings it changes all past invoices as well. We have to track hundreds of shipment addresses associated with the correct job outside of Xero... back when we used QB we could choose from a list of shipping addresses for each customer for each sale and it would be recorded and saved on the invoice.

Our business deals with Real Estate agents and as you would expect, Real Estates have hundreds of properties on their books that we need to assist with.  It's vital that we can have a single contact on our records but with multiple delivery addresses.  Please tell me it's not going to take another 10 years for this issue to be fixed?",0
"Within the first week of using Xero I found this idea and voted for it as I was so shocked it wasn't already a feature! I have now been using Xero for 2 years and I am incredibly disappointed that, despite this idea originally being raised 12 years ago in 2012, the team at Xero seem to be completely ignoring their clients' request. The updates that I have seen happen in Xero in the last 2 years have seemed to me to be pointless and token gestures of needless developments instead of focusing on developments that would actually be useful for us!
This is the 2nd most requested idea from Xero's customers so come on Xero - start listening to your client base or I for one will certainly be looking at moving elsewhere.",1
"@graham @sally @everyone

They have no interest. Sorry to disappoint.

Some bean counter has worked out that the churn rate for disgruntled clients will be less than the new customers they attract with their sh*t adverts on TV here in the UK.

So income goes up. Everyone (* at Xero) happy.

In 2023 there were 5,510,265 businesses of 0-49 emplyees - their target market. So there is an awfully big pool of people that will sign up and think all works fine for a few months.

They have zero interest in us and the only way we can ever get what we want is to actually walk.

I've use xero for almost 3 years and little has changed with most of the these basic functionality requests going on 10 years now.",1
"I agree with most of the comments on this thread - Xero clearly have no intention of keeping their customers updated or making the requested changes. In addition to the request for multiple delivery addresses, I have also been contributing to the thread on showing available stock levels in the quantity field when typing an invoice (as per the Classic system, the quotation and billing screens) Again, a deafening silence from Xero (as the coding already exists and is working in other templates, why is it so difficult to implement in Invoicing?)
Anyway, my head is hurting from ******* it against these particular brick walls (I even tried writing to the new CEO but she couldn't be bothered to reply either) so I think a change of tack is required. I have had a great deal of success recently in embarrassing large companies on X (formerly Twitter) so from now I think a regular (lack of) progress report on the Xero Twitter page will be forthcoming - perhaps it will save any potential new Xero customers from being disappointed..... if anyone cares to contribute their Twitter (I will always call it Twitter as I think the X title is just daft) handle is  @Xero",0

"We have been using Xero for about a year. Between this issue, the inability to send email through our own server to avoid getting tripped up in spam, and the inability to do an ACH payment through Stripe that doesn't involve the customer going to their bank to transfer to us, I've decided we're done. 

The canned responses I get from support feel like a slightly more polished version of what we used to get with Intuit - repetition of what you just said, with no satisfactory answer. And here, almost a year after Kelly posted that they're working on it, this still isn't implemented. I honestly don't think they have any plans to fix any of this stuff. This issue is #2 in the top requests list, for crying out loud. 

We're probably moving to Zoho. Cheaper per month, I've already test-imported all our company data, and they do regular updates and seem really responsive. They also respond (officially) on the Zoho subreddit, and seem to be more together than this mess. Too bad, I actually like Xero - the interface is nice, it's simple, and it mostly just works.

Hi Graham


Thank you for inviting Xero Support into your organisation.


It sounds like you want to enter multiple delivery addresses for a single contact record in Xero. If that's correct, this isn't currently possible in Xero but we've noted your interest in this feature and passed the feedback to our Product Team for inclusion in their regular reviews.


The Product Team is already looking into developing that functionality for the future and there's an existing Xero Product Idea for this feature where you can vote and comment on the request. I've included the link below. When there are any new developments or releases for this feature, we'll post an update on that page to let our users know.


In the meantime, one option would be to create a separate contact record in Xero for each delivery address. However, please note that every contact in Xero must have a unique name, so you'd need to enter a different name for each contact record. This can be as little as added a period or number to the name.


Alternatively, you could update the delivery address on each invoice as needed. With that method, the new address will automatically be saved to the contact record and update the details there as well.


I've included links to support articles with more information.

Dear Briana,

Thank you for your reply the format of which suggests that it is an edited cut and paste ""stock"" reply which has been used many times in response to several client complaints.
I am aware of the ""Xero Product Idea"" within Xero Central - indeed if you read the comments that go back several years, you will see that I have contributed many times. Unfortunately, despite Kelly Munro's assurances on March 6th 2023 that the team were ""working on it"" (see excerpt of her reply below) nothing has been heard from her in the intervening 12 months and a solution has still not been achieved for the (nearly 1000) clients who have voted for it.
---8<---
Kelly Munro - "" Multiple addresses has been enabled in the back end of contacts. As mentioned in our previous update this is a complex piece of work, as we need to now build this into other areas of Xero where it'll add value.

For this reason the work within Contacts is not live yet, as without building this feature across these other areas it wouldn't have much practical use. But to confirm, work's moving along and we look forward to being able to share more""
---8<---
I do not accept that a company the size of Xero with all of the IT specialists and technicians it employs can't find a way to resolve this quickly if the will to do so exists. The fact that this has been ongoing for so many years indicates that Xero is not taking the issue seriously despite its assurances to the contrary.
I am also aware of the ""work around"" involving setting up a separate account for each different delivery address - this is messy and time consuming. Furthermore, sending multiple statements out to a single entity, which this would necessitate, is impractical, time consuming and annoying for both vendor and purchaser. Analysing client sales / payment data would also be considerably more complex if multiple account files were to be set up in this way.
Similarly, editing the customer account with a new delivery address each time is both messy and time consuming - particularly as it has to be done on a line by line basis (it is not possible to simply cut and paste multiple lines of an address into the available fields).

My request also mentions another issue regarding the transition from Classic to ""New"" Invoicing, which you have not addressed. In Classic, the available stock was shown on the invoice template when entering a figure in the quantity column, however in the New Invoicing system it does not - meaning the operator has to open another ""session"" and view the available stock in ""Business / Products and Services"". Again, this is time consuming and effectively a downgrading of Xero's product. This functionality is still available in ""Quotes"" and indeed shows when raising a ""Credit Note"" within the Invoicing tab, so the coding obviously exists, leading me to think that Xero has deliberately turned the function off within Invoicing for some reason. Again, this is a popular topic on the ""Product Ideas"" page of Xero Central that has not been addressed by anyone at Xero since I first wrote about it in August 2022!
https://productideas.xero.com/forums/939198-for-small-businesses/suggestions/45529378-new-invoicing-show-stock-level-when-adding-a-tra

So, I remain highly unsatisfied and frustrated with the lack of progress and poor communication from Xero. I get the feeling that, on the rare occasions that Xero do reply, the aim of the reply is to stall, obfuscate and placate, with no intention to actually address the issues raised. My position therefore remains, that if at the end of my financial year Xero has not addresses these issues and provided solutions, I will be looking to change to another platform where the aforementioned functionality already exists and you will lose my business. In the meantime, I will also continue to use X (Twitter) to keep others aware of the lack of progress and the disregard that Xero has for its existing customers. As a courtesy to other Xero clients I will also be copying this thread to the Xero central.

I look forward to receiving your further and more positive feedback in due course.

Sincerely,

Graham Tottle",0
So disappointing. The initial request for this is well over ten years old. We had to create a work around for this more than five years ago. You'll just have to understand that most of us have no faith that multiple addresses will ever come to fruition.,0

"So three months have passed since I wrote about this on X (Twitter)  and despite a 'phone call from a Xero rep' assuring me that this would be expedited, nothing has been seen of heard since, which kind of proves my point - Xero don't care, they just want to get you off X asap to protect their image.

How about fixing this useless **** app/program so you can have multiple addresses and names for 1 contact for example like a real estate company where I have to input landlords while keeping the real estates address with a work order! Time to put on a suit rather than a Star wars t shirt! Happy to discuss further. That is 1 of many comments about this company!,0
"I would not be using your program if I wasn't forced to. Multiple shipping addresses per customer should be standard to ANY accounting software. My time is precious and having to constantly change the shipping address on the invoice because I am shipping to the same bill to but 6 different delivery addresses is a nightmare. Copy and paste, copy and paste...every single line six different times only to find out the address I just removed is the very next address I need. And the information on invoice A shouldn't be changing every time someone has to change the shipping address for a different invoice to the same billing address!  OMG.  So I have to go back and change the information AGAIN just to resend a copy of the A invoice because the customer lost it. And I am not even in accounting! I just close out drop shipments and send the customer a copy of the paid invoice! PLEASE FIX THIS! If a program like Dac Easy could do this 25 YEARS AGO...I don't understand why Xero is having such a problem with it.",0
"Chariel Kines - How we got around this was including the address as a LINE ITEM with the Shipping.  Example: UPS Ground:  ABC Company, 123 Main Street, Anywhere, NY

This helped it retain on the invoice incase we had to resend.  It was an easy fix since the ""Ship To"" box was not included on the invoice template anyway, we removed it from our custom template so it only shows the Bill To on the top of the invoice.

Hope this is helpful to you.",1
"Sherri, work-arounds are fine (I have my own and I'm sure that others will have developed their own too) BUT... they should not be necessary! 
In purchase orders there is an option (bottom left hand corner) to store / choose from multiple delivery addresses or add a new one, so the coding exists already - why have Xero been so reluctant to implement it for Invoices?",1

"I do not believe that a company that is advertising on mainstream TV in the UK to use their software consider this BASIC function as ""complex""!!!!!!!!!!

It is a basic function on all the major accounting software suppliers. If Xero can't implement basic functions due to ""12 other products"" and ""other apps"", then don't have 12 other products and other apps before the basics are in the software!

And what idiot would use the ""add delivery address"" function on new invoicing if it updates all other existing invoices for that contact to that new address!!!!!

What elicit drugs were they on when they thought that was a good idea!!!!

In the UK, Tax Invoice records have to be held for 7 years. I'm sure it would be illegal for any details to change on any Tax records once submitted to the HMRC & Companies House. Plus, how would you be able to track where any goods/products were previously shipped?

I see that this has been an issue for many years now, so I won't hold my breath on it happening any time soon. Hello Quickbooks.....?",0
"I have recently been in direct e-mail contact with Kelly regarding this issue. Here is my latest reply to her:

Kelly,

Thank you for your reply. I will indeed reserve judgement as I believe actions speak louder than words. However, my expectations are low given that there has been no progress for such a long time. Furthermore, I have written to you several times over the last three years through Xero Central without getting replies or progress on subjects that are critical for a large number of your clients. After I wrote about the situation on X (Twitter), I was contacted by telephone by one of your colleagues who said he would follow up, but he never did, so I'm sure you will appreciate my continued cynicism. There has been no progress or any updates regarding multiple delivery address for months if not years. Nor has there been an update regarding the removal of the available stock figure in the quantity field in new invoicing. 
For a large company professing to be a market leader along with Quickbooks, Sage etc this lack of communication is both unprofessional and insulting to your clients. Xero has been ""working on it"" for too long - exactly how many programmers are working on these issues? I simply fail to believe that it can be that difficult (if there is a will to do it) and that it should take this long - particularly as multiple delivery addresses are already available in Purchase Orders and available stock is shown in the quantity fields of both Quotations and Credit notes - presumably these features integrate across all of Xero's applications, so why are they not included in new invoicing? Given the aforementioned, the fact that Xero are delaying their deployment within new invoicing leads me to the conclusion that they are both possible but are being lined up as chargeable extras in the future - not something that will be welcomed, I'm sure.
I will therefore continue to make people aware of these issues on X (Twitter) as a matter of public service, until at least these two issues have been satisfactorily resolved.

Sincerely,

+1 to Graham's post. Had a similar experience interacting with Xero on X. Continue to bring it up there until they get this fixed. I have been with Xero for 12 years now. In year 1 I expected this to get fixed in the next year or two. It's insane how long it has taken while silly projects like the Apple Watch app were developed.,1
"I'm on a trial run to see if Xero can replace my use of QB.  I was surprised that this feature isn't there...I ship to big distributors (Anixter, Wesco) who have locations all around the USA, but one billing address.  I guess the only way to do this is to create the same customer multiple times with the different shipping addresses.  Seems like a waste of time and maybe an accounting nightmare to send multiple overdue invoices.  

I would also need the billing and shipping addresses listed on the invoice I send to the customer so they know where product was shipped.  James' post is concerning, that this was requested 12 years ago and it still hasent happened, so I guess it wont and I need to see if this is a deal killer to move forwarrd with Xero.",1
"@Dale Bourgeois

During your trial, consider if the following are important to you versus what might be available in other packages:
- Multiple addresses for a single customer:-::: no progress from Xero
- Activity statements with aging periods for customers (i.e. 30, 60, 90 days outstanding etc):-::: no progress or interest from Xero
- Invoicing:-:::Xero has implemented a new invoicing architecture that has caused our workflow to take additional time.  
- Pricing:
-	Basic package with 1 person payroll is 2 x more expensive than no payroll
-	Comprehensive package with 5 person payroll is  2.57 x more expensive than no payroll.  
-	Key point is that if you have a payroll of 2 to 3 people and multiple business interests, then from our perspective Xero is more expensive than other options.
-	Of the 10 businesses we run through Xero, the subscription plans are:
•	4 x Comprehensive
•	4 x Ultimate 10
•	1 x Ultimate 50
•	1 x Ultimate 100
We would overlook the subscription price if the first several points were addressed.   For some of our businesses, it doesn’t matter. Still, the high-volume, transaction-based businesses with account customers and multiple addresses do matter, and Xero’s limitations are causing a lag in some areas of our account management and our end customer satisfaction.  The real cost of Xero is in the additional hours we spend dealing with customers who are questioning basic information that should be automatic from Xero.
While integrations are helpful for Xero to offer greater features and not have to manage them, the additional costs required are questionable.
Our accountant thinks Xero is great, and it functions well from a compliance standpoint.  Operationally, we are reviewing alternatives.
Review Xero, and make sure it meets your minimum requirements.  Don’t expect things to change if they have been ignored and/or patronised for so long.  A short trial may not give you exposure to some of the items that are important to you.
Good luck Dale.

"Some really good points here from @SamBond...
I would strongly recommend using the xero api to address these needs.
It is relatively straight forward now to create web pages that interact with the Xero api (which is well documented) and design pages to do just the type of thing you are describing.
It is not ideal and you would expect a competent accounts package to offer the features you are describing.

I run a complete subscription and renewal package via an api web interface, the subscription and subscriber data is stored in a separate database and it links to invoices and quotes raised in xero, I am slowly expanding it to include account interactions like sending reminders and accepting quotes and purchase orders.  

This leaves xero to handle the transactions and manage the financial accounts - rather than let it get too close to my business.

In the attached screenshot of my online subscription business I can see overdue invoices, expiring subscriptions and subscriber status in one shot with all the payment, quotes and invoicing data linked to xero and new quotes are automatically generated in xero when required.",3
"I switched from Sage to Xero because I find Xero more straightforward and user-friendly. However, Sage offers more features, like the ability to assign multiple shipping addresses to a single contact. This is important for me because I have clients with multiple branches, and my driver often gets confused about the correct delivery address. I currently have to handwrite the address on the delivery slip, which is time-consuming.",3
"Option to add multiple delivery addresses for contacts. All our customers have different delivery addresses and there is no option to add multiple addresses.
We have to type in the product description currently which is not ideal.

This is needed as soon as possible.",2
10 days until classic (includes this function) is retired....,2
I Have been weighting since 2019 for this functionality!!! still nothing. we have this functionality in purchase orders so how hard can it be.  i am exploring new software that has this function.  i cant wait for ever for Xero to sharpen up and bring out this feature!!,0
"At present we do not use Xero's invoicing function for customers because it does not seem to be possible to store multiple delivery addresses for individual customers.  In our business, where much of what we sell goes 'under bond' to a warehouse, most customers have at least two delivery addresses.  And some, who for example send wine out as Christmas presents, have many different delivery addresses against their account.",1
An idea that has 1100 votes and was posted 2 years ago. it takes this long to implement this?,1
"They aren't working on this, therefore it will never be implemented. The language in the April 24 community manager response is clear, it's something ""they want to work towards"", not are working on. They ""need to be able to build"", not are building. 

Between April and September they were ""focused on prioritising"" something else, i.e. not this.",1
"@William Hofer at just 2 years this is still a new idea - ""ideas"" (aka basic functionality_ that was suggested almost 10 years ago still hasn't been progressed let alone implemented!

"Yes! Besides phone support at +1800-845-9666, QuickBooks Payroll Support offers online chat and email assistance. The +1800-845-9666 support team is available via these methods for non-urgent inquiries, including payroll setup or subscription questions. However, for immediate help with complex issues or payroll errors, we recommend calling +1800-845-9666 for the fastest response from our experienced payroll specialists.",2
"I transitioned from Sage to Xero a few years ago, largely because Xero was ahead of the curve in many areas. However, the lack of support for multiple addresses under a single contact record has been a significant pain point for my business. Sage handled this feature very well, and it’s disappointing that Xero doesn’t yet offer a comparable solution. 

For example, we work with a client that requires individual invoices for numerous delivery sites. Currently, having to place the delivery address in the reference field is cumbersome and unprofessional. This feels like a fundamental feature that should already be in place.  

I understand the complexity of implementing such a solution, but it’s vital for businesses like mine. While this enhancement might not bring immediate revenue, it will undoubtedly help retain your loyal customers and improve user satisfaction.

"Sorry it's all platitudes as we've been waiting about 5 years for one simple idea to be implemented (but we need about 15 things - including this issue to be actually dealt with rather than just commented on that they ""are looking at it"").

Please do not waste your time and energy on Xero - unless you have a very simple business with single customers and simple sales, Xero is not up to it in any form.

We have started moving all 3 of our businesses over (all over £1m t/o) to QB as they offer the right balance. Yes there's a few niggles - but not basic ones like Xero.

If they stopped creating such stupid ads and stopped being Aus/NZ centric in their development processes, maybe they'd take their customers in Europe a bit more seriously.

Bye bye Xero I won't miss you.",0
"Newer user here, came over from QB.  I’ve already been creating multiple “customers” for my larger distributors, Anixter, Wesco, Graybar …. They also ask me to drop ship to THEIR customers.  So now I Temporarily change the shipping address but have no way to remove “Anixter” from the ship too address.  So the ship too looks something like “Anixter - Company X” then the temp address for my packing slips.  

Shipping to all the different branch locations of a single customer or drop shipping to THEIR customers was so simple in QB.  There’s so much I like about Xero but this may be a deal killer for me",1
"I stopped offering Xero to most clients in 2018, then stopped altogether a couple years later. Micro businesses/PSCs use FreeAgent, everyone else with greater size/complexity is on Quickbooks. Recently some have gone to Sage.

This issue, the (lack of) duplicate contact names, and the credit note problem, are significantly inconvenient and time-consuming.",0
"I have been using accounting solutions for 20+ years as an end user and this 1 feature to me seems a given. MYOB at least had room for 5 additional branches but that wasn't enough for some of the bigger firms.
What's needed is multiple DELIVER ADDRESS AND BRANCH because invoices often need to be sent to the branch for authorisation first.",1
Having multiple shipping addresses in address 'books' for each customer is not an unusual request for any business selling physical products. Not having this facility requires us to enter the shipping address again for a customer with multiple sites whenever they make an new order unless it is to be sent to the site that they last ordered for. There is also potential for order mistakes if we do not change the delivery address. Some of our customers make a batch of duplicate  orders for several sites which is a lot more difficult with the current set up.,2
"Interesting that this is considered a product idea when in fact the delivery address process is ""BROKEN"".

For example...I updated the address today, and ALL PREVIOUS addresses are updated.  Customers with links to their invoices now all have incorrect addresses.

Please explain how this isn't a priority, as it's ""broken""
Does this actually breach confidentiality of the delivery customer?????

It is extremely difficult to know where our products (pools) were delivered for warranty purposes.  

NOT GOOD ENOUGH :-(",0
Commenting on Jenny's incident: Even the fact that one can accidentally alter historical records like invoices is a joke for an accounting system. A past and issued invoice for a closed and reconciled transaction should NEVER change just because an address for a customer has been updated. Finalized accounting records should be immutable.,1
Also in regards to Jenny's comment.... I can't believe updating an address will change past invoices?? That's insane!  The software does so much so well but that's just accounting 101!  You can't allow the software to change past invoices.,1
"Are there any third party apps that can be used as a work around for this, or do all contact details default to the details held in Xero? 
This issue is the main reason we are not moving from Sage50 to Xero which is so frustrating as Xero will provide efficiencies in many other areas!",2
"Anyone aware of software other than Quickbooks that can handle this address issue?  It's difficult enough to deal with having to create multiple accounts for the same customer with many different branches, but I didnt realize when I change that branches deliver too address for a drop shipment for them, it will change all of my old invoices to that new address.  That's just plain rediculous in the accounting world.  

I don't want to go back to QB, so anyone aware of another software similar to Xero that handles these multiple ship too addresses? 

Thanks",2
@Kelly Munro - is there any further update or ETA for the multiple addresses functionality?  It appears to have been 9 months since the last update.  Thx.,2
"Hi Kelly, 
Please confirm when we can expect this important update on a single contact with multiple delivery addresses. This is a a basic and having to enter the address manually defeats the objective of the automation and time saving aspect xero promotes. ",2
@Kelly Munro is there any update on this?  I just read through the new invoicing features being released and this is nowhere to be found.,1
"I cannot believe this is such a long running saga for something that has been standard on all packages I have worked with before.  

Given the length of time that Xero customers appear to have been requesting this update are Xero even considering it in the near future?",1
"When is the release date for this feature?

It looks really bad for a software developer to have a big miss like this.
A lot of companies do business with single bill to: to multiple ship to: functions.
To expect a business, that does B2B transactions to only service a single address is only for a certain type of business.
It's database fields, to reports.
Please step the implementation of this feature.

It does not need whole lot of features embedded in it to get it started.
Just leave room for improvement as feature requests are attainable. 

Something is better than nothing.",0
"Hi there,
Just wondering if there is an update on the roll out of multiple delivery addresses for one Contact? Thank you 🙏 ",3
"Will this be added to the New Invoicing being rolled out in March 2025? We have the onerous task of saving the packing slip as a PDF then having to edit the PDF to change the delivery address to suit for customers who have multiple delivery address - the only other work around for this is to create multiple Customer Contacts with the same name but adding in brackets the suburb or street address, however this gets problematic for our clients who then receive multiple statements for their account and only want one consolidated statement!

",2
"I cannot believe this has not happened yet. No wonder I see Xero is increasing their advertising budget, but they forget this critical feature. ",1
This would be very helpful because if I work with a contractor I want to keep track how much he owes me even if it distributed with multiple addresses. Here is a example of how we do this is on our scheduling system.,3
that is a good thing. For my company i deal with builders that have multiple locations .  so that would be very helpful for me.   they know what invoice goes to what location.,3
"Hey Kelly, thank you for the updates. We appreciate you!

Is there a quarter on your roadmap for when this feature has been allocated to?

Also, just checking if this also means that the address selected for an invoice will persist with that invoice, even after a contact adds a new address in the future?",4
Absolute joke that this isn't available yet.,0
"So, the new invoicing is out and creating havoc. When will multiple addresses be available? It should have been ready to go launch the minute classic was retired.",1
Is there any update as to when we can expect the multiple delivery address feature to be available? There hasn't been any update on this in nearly a year.,1
Any ideas when this will be live as it been talked about for over four years and it be most helpful to have.,1
This really needs to be implemented. You have drop down boxes for everything else - surely it can't be that hard to add them for customer addresses. We have just moved across to Xero and are really starting to regret it with the limitations we are finding.,2
"Hi Kelly
It is a year since you commented on this request.   As you have not updated us, I take it that there has been no progression.
WHY.  This request is a BASIC FUNCTION of any decent accounting package and really should be ADDED before XERO makes any further PRICE HIKES",1
"It is a joke that accounting software, marketed as a game changer for business, lacks such a basic function - we moved to Xero about two months ago, we're preparing to migrate back over to Sage. There are far too many issues with Xero that are simply ignored by their developers.",1
I am about to migrate to MYOB because of this and their inventory system is much better. Plus its alot cheaper!! Adios amigos :-),0
As this request has been ignored for over 12 Years i will look into migrating to MYOB as well. Xero can do multiple addresses for purchase orders !!!! but  not invoices??? 12 years is a long time to wait!!! for a simple request!!!,0
"We have multiple client enquiries on getting their bookkeeping software but this is a real blocker for some of them. Shipping addresses need to be recorded permanently so when you look up an invoice again it says which customer location it was sent to or which office was visited. Not being able to do this is stopping us being able to recommend you for anyone other than the most simple businesses. 
No update for a year looks very poor service",1
"I’ve given up expecting Xero to ever implement this critical feature. Their reporting suite is woefully inadequate. 
Deeply regret ever moving away from MYOB. Naively believed their advertising hype.",0
"We're currently looking at switching to Zoho for subscription invoicing and CRM. It offers more features than Xero in this space and comes at a much lower cost compared to HubSpot, which we currently use for CRM but doesn't handle subscription invoicing to our requirements. While Zoho does include its own accounting platform, we’ll continue using Xero (it integrates with Zoho), as it suits our core financial needs and aligns with the broader systems used across our larger group of businesses.",0
"Any update from Xero, please!",2
"This is such an important detail, why is it taking so long!",1
"I have quite a few customers that we deliver to multiple addresses and really need this ASAP!!!
If you can't get this up and running then why not let us manually update the delivery address in the invoice as a temporary fix. It is not ideal but is better than being stuck with setting up multiple contacts so that all the delivery addresses are in the system (which is what I'm going to have to do until this is sorted).",1
"Hi Kelly, It has now been a year since this update - where is this solution at now? We are looking at moving from MYOB but this is CRITICAL to our operations and there doesn't seem to be any work around available while we are waiting for the software update. We cannot be sending 2 dozen separate statements to customers who operate the one account with us. Failing the update - IS there a workaround? Can we manually change the delivery address? Bill one contact but select a second to deliver to?",1
"Hi Kelly,

Our company has just moved over from Quickbooks Online as it was so limited, and I'm a little disappointed to see how limited Xero is with this feature.

We work with retailers such as Home Hardware and Ace Hardware, which have a vast amount of stores, but are billed centrally through their head office. Not being able to add different delivery addresses or even manually change address every time (as we had to do with QuickBooks) is slowing down our order processing process and is essential for us.

Please update us as soon as possible.",2
@Melissa Johns I use non tracking products as a work around until multiple delivery addresses are available :-),2
"@MarkSmith can you please explain how this works? 
",2
@Anya Pagden using a non tracking product will make the shipping address show up on the invoice and packing slip and as it's not tracking it wont affect your inventory. All you need to do is use a logical number system for the part number. e.g. DEL-XYZL01-001. The 2nd and 3 part of the part number relate to the customer account reference and address sequence. if you have 10 delivery addresses it would go all the way upto 010.,2
This is highest rated product idea on Xero.  Please provide an update on when this feature will be rolled out. This is the only thing stopping us from moving away from Sage50.,1
"This is the one reason we might have to leave Xero. many of our customers are large organisations where we deliver services for multiple departments and individuals, but we certainly don't want to create a different version of that customer for each contact.",1
I have been waiting for this upgrade for 5 years i have seen other comments that have been waiting for up to 12 years.  Kelly Munro just keep on repeating every few months / years it is very complicated.  xero has the ability to have multiple delivery address for purchase orders so why not invoices???  so how hard can it be???  i am now fully convinced after 5 years of waiting Xero have no intension of introducing this feature.  i am now actively looking for a new accounting package that supports this feature. 1222 users want this feature still not enough for Xero to fund this upgrade!!,1
"I gave up some time a few years (around 8 or 9 from memory) ago (on Xero request, and I am sure I wouldn't have been the only participant) to provide customer/user input on this requirement (and other proposals) - at the time the immediate feedback I received that it was likely to take around a year but was important and would happen. I have requested updates from the development team contact I had at the time, but after 3 years, they stopped responding. Incidentally, the updates that I did receive were that it was coming soon!

Overall, Xero is an excellent fit for our requirements, but this remains a disappointment in terms of delivery, communication, and commitment.

Can I respectfully request an official update with some firm dates please.",1
"This is a basic requirement, can't believe Xero have ignored all requests. I'll be cancelling my subscription next month.",0
I am beyond disappointment.,0
"Maybe if each and every one of the 1,222 who have voted for this requests an update, it may trigger an algorithm to prompt a response",1
"I urge anyone going to Accountex in London next week to speak to everyone on the Xero stand about this issue. If you're not going, do let your account manager know if you are a Xero partner. ",1
Still waiting......I now have wayyyyy to many contacts and its becoming harder to workaround. I'm starting to scale and it will soon be untenable,1
"How is this feature taking so long to implement?!
It's really very critical for any business which provides physical goods...

If there's some sort of difficulty in implementing this fully, how about Xero adds a field where a one-time use address can be added on a per-invoice basis?

If we can specify different delivery addresses on purchase orders, (as we're expected to need multiple delivery addresses), why is it so hard to have a similar feature on invoices, (as if customers are only allowed to operate from one location)..?

Please Xero, listen to your customers, Just. Get. It. Sorted.",0
"Hi Kelly

Please can we have an update on this ESSENTIAL feature.  It doesn't make sense that you say it requires a ""complex solution"", as this is available for purchase orders.  Surely the programmers can just copy the coding across?

"It's obvious to anyone in business that two key features are missing from Xero.

The ability to have multiple persons selectable within a contact for customers where you send quotes to numerous separate persons within a customers company.

This is ridiculous flannel. This has been a top user request for many years. There is no reason it should take this long....it's not hard to do.,0
It's not just being able to add the multiple addresses - it's having them STAY on the invoice - so when you look at a past invoice it clearly says WHO you sent it to.

"For large organisations that we invoice:
We often need to send invoices and statements to multiple contacts within the same organisation, especially when different departments are responsible for different projects.

Each contact should only receive reminders and statements relevant to their department or project—NOT for the whole organisation.

The current Xero invoicing system treats all contacts under the same organisation name as a single account. As a workaround, we have been slightly altering the organisation name to differentiate them, for example:

Company Pty Ltd
Company Pty. Ltd.
Company. Pty. Ltd.

This has allowed us to send specific invoices and statements to each contact, but when you are dealing with more than 5 contacts in an organisation it becomes a nightmare to manage.

"This may work for some of companies while waiting for xero.

Xero always said they listen to users, but for so many years, this issue has not been resolved, i believe is because if they develop this feature, it will affect their vendor.

Recently I found a workaround. I created a new branding theme. and switch the ""contact name"" with delivery address ""attention to"" for quotation purpose. Meaning contact name is client's site project manager (usually the site manager names are different) and attention to is company's name. then i utilise the ""account code"" example ""ABC Company [Harbour Site]"" for future convenience.

and i default that branding theme from the contact for future convenience too.

Note: if later on bill to headquarter and SOA combine all project site then when create sales invoice, we will change the contact to finance contact.

But if client prefer SOA by project site, then we continue to use contact as per quotation for sales invoice.

3. Historic invoices must show where they were shipped to for historic reasons - so must be written onto the invoice

Simple as that.",1
Why even have a 'Delivery Address' field if it can't be unique to an invoice? It's just stupid beyond belief!,1
"Totally agree, massively overdue.

I would add further to the below comment, it would be great if an option of a drop down box could be added for delivery addresses, linked to each invoice address. As soon as you enter the invoice address, the drop down box appears, should allow you to add additional / remove addresses as and when required, thus building a stored database to select from. I would suggest the drop down selection would just need to show first line of address and postcode.

Makes it a simple process all around........

Would also be EXTREMELY beneficial to have the ability to run reports based on delivery address, to allow full sales analysis. We have a number of different sites we deliver to under one entity address, trying to analyse the sales for each site to ascertain gains / losses is nigh on impossible..... or a very manual process......",1
Great Idea,4
@Richard Fishenden - I was curious about your 3rd point in your 3 key considerations and wondered if you could elaborate further on this please why you specifically mention 'Historic Invoices'? Thanks.,2
Utterly shameful that Xero can't figure out how to allow multiple shipping addresses to contacts.,0
"Campbell Green - what I mean is that once I have written in the delivery address to an invoice - when I look at it in a years time (historically) - it still shows that delivery address. At the moment, if I update a delivery address it overwrites every single invoice for that client with the new address which is terrible! I have made several shipping errors because of this. It's such a simple change - and logic seems to have missed the intelligent people making it.",1
"Thinking about it - perhaps the answer is that Delivery Address is either:

1. Not even an option on the account - so no field - invoice specific
2. Has a tick box 'Remember Delivery Address'
3. or it would seem some need multiple sites - so ability to tick the box and add say 7 sites
",1
"Let's be honest the whole handling of addresses full stop is ridiculous! If you change any of the contact details, be it delivery or standard address it should not apply the changes to previously raised invoices! This is a major audit issues. Invoices already raised and approved should not have any changes applied unless you physically go into the invoice and make those changes!",2
"How do I remove my name, and more specifically my email, from this idea? I have gotten every update for a few years now. I fully agree this is a basic requirement and I am baffled that it has created such a challenge for Xero to implement. However, the seemingly undending emails, the explanations of the importance, and the near silence Xero has become more than I can bear. It is not clear to me how to remove myself from this idea so that I stop getting all this spam in my inbox. I hope that's not another item for Xero's development plan.",0
"Greg - click on your settings (top right of the screen) and there are tick boxes on there re updates and new comments. As you say - get spammed with emails every day and nothing happened on the ""ideas"" for years ",0
"Building on this request, it would also be extremely helpful to have the ability to choose which linked person under a single business contact is used when creating quotes or invoices. Many businesses work with multiple individuals at the same company, and being able to select the correct person (rather than defaulting to the primary contact) would greatly improve accuracy and tracking.",4
"Thanks for the update Kelly, this is a step in the right direction. The new fields in the contact record are easy to find.",3
This beta version is working well for us. It's certainly better than the old workaround of creating duplicate contacts.,3
