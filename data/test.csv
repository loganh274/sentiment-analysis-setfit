"Lisa Diamond- Welcome to Xero product ideas, where important product feature requests go to die.  Or just ignored for decades.  It's been over THIRTEEN years Xero seriously!!",0
"I can't believe Xero hasn't thought about this when creating this software. Customers would require different delivery address to manage inventory. 
Also it updates the address to all invoiced/quotes for the particular customer. It's very hard to trust the system and have to keep separate system to ensure orders are shipped to correct address. Not sure why it is taking so long for Xero developers to add a field and make it operational. ",0
"Hi Kelly , i have looked back through the threads on this subject and it seams this issue has been raised since 2020 , is it ever going to happen?

BTW todays upgrade has screwed with all our internal workarounds that we have used to get around the lack of Multiple deliver addresses .... we like Xero but if you cant do this simple change in 2 years i think its time for us to bite the bullet and go back to softwear that can....",0
Agree with Benjamin on 16.08.22 - this is such a basic feature. Time to move a batch of clients back to Sage - hugely embarrassing and a complete waste of time.,0
This is incredibly important - we have many customers with multiple service locations and some of these customers won't accept Xero invoices due to the fact we can't show the service location address on the invoice unless we update it on the system every single time which is time consuming when Xero is supposed to be making our lives easier!,0
"WAY TO GO XERO......

Instead of fixing this issue, you have changed the way that you update client details.  Instead of amending client postal address, physical address and phone number etc on the one screen, lets put in a process that takes three times as long as you have to go into three different screens to update this information.

Why do your programmers insist on creating more problems instead of fixing that ones that we have been asking for for over 10 years......

Seriously, where is the thought process here??",0
"Very disappointed after been sold Xero as very intuitive and easy software and turns out that one of the most basic fields on invoicing is not been implemented from the start. I cannot believe that every time we have to resend invoices we have to type manually the delivery address and save it in the pc doubling the work and making other functionalities on Xero worthless. 

This is a very basic functionality and the fact that changes the invoice details based on the contact address is just very poor.

I hope you can resolve this very soon as I can see people are been asking for a few years already and nothing is been done yet.
",0
"is Xero ever going to fix this???
seems like a fairly basic requirement and yet no comment from Xero on when a fix will be implemented. I asked for this over 5 years ago and was told it was being done then. so far silence! happy to take my money though. ",0
I find it appalling that this is not an option.  I have one client with 8 different stores and I cannot save their delivery addresses under the one account.  Xero get your act together!,0
It seems this Product Idea was created in 2012 - 10 years ago! Is this idea ever going to be a reality? Something that seems so essential Xero is missing. Quite disappointing.,0
We will not jump on-board till this issue is addressed,0
"Again I like to voice my frustration about Xero's present ""simple"" address management. We just prepared a quote to a client and client requested on the quote the address to be for branch B. So we had to change the client's address to address B and then issue the quote. 

What I did not expect is that this procedure also changes the address on all former and accepted quotes to this client. Quotes are important contractual and legal document forming part of the purchase contract and once a quote is accepted it should never change. At least not unintentionally.",0
"Hello XERO! Please make this possible by this quarter! This feature is very critical! There is an option to choose multiple addresses in Purchase but NOT in SALES. How come???

I am looking forward to this feature very soon!!!",0
"Just spent ages trying to figure out why I can't have multiple customer names/addresses for the same business. Now I find out this isn't supported!!
Sorry but this is a pathetic oversight. I'm now regretting migrating to Xero from MYOB.
This is a MUST HAVE FEATURE!",0
"Greg, I totally agree with you. Regretting moving from Reckon Desktop. Xero has created twice as much work for me, without the basic functionality that even Open Source packages have. We have one customer that may have 100 different site addresses in one year, and Xero is creating a nightmare.",0
"Can we get an estimated date when this might be available, this is very frustrating for a significant number of users and has been on the to-do list forever. 
I have read the statement above that suggests it's being looked at, but it's still very non-specific as to when we might actually see something. ",0
"378 votes and 10 months and still nothing from Xero. Kelly Munro stated in September that Xero are working on it, but nothing since then. This is unacceptable in terms of basic customer service in A) sorting out an issue that so many are being inconvenienced by and B) updating their clients as to progress. I am really not interested in excuses from Xero about how complex their systems are, we need solutions not excuses and platitudes. I find it inconceivable that Xero do not have coders / IT specialists who could sort this out quickly if there is there is actually the will to do it.
Maybe it's time to take to Twitter (@Xero) to advise potential new clients how poorly their customers are treated......",0
"I think xero is overthinking this.  The way it works in quickbooks and others is you can freeform paste in a shipping address during invoice creating.  Since our clients jobs (contruction) go from address to address, it is not important to keep this info in a record beyond just the invoice.

Let me repeat: we have customers where the shipping invoice is NEVER the same and it changes EVERY bill.

What most people are doing now in xero is adding it to the reference field or pasting in a ""freight"" item line.  So why not just have an optionally-filled ship to line that can be pasted into as customers are already doing with these workarounds??",0
Please upgrade this asap!! If the technology needs upgrading for such a simple feature then this should be priority otherwise how else will anything be upgraded. Really considering moving to MYOB...,0
"So... our pathetic solution is to create multiple accounts for the same client but add a full stop or 2 to their name. Disgusting solution, God forbid they ask for a monthly statement!",0
The ability to set up one customer with multiple delivery addresses is a pretty basic function and one that many other on line providers offer as standard. Please release this functionality ASAP.,1
I'm surprised this important/basic feature has been ignored for so long by Xero.,1
"We also require something along these lines i.e. the ability to assign an individual in an organisation to a department such as, the PO contact, the accounts contact, the sales contact etc. So the system is intelligent enough to know when you are sending a PO, which emails to send it to and so on. 

We have to essentially add the contact details right now, select include in emails and then try to remember who POs go to, who invoices go to and delete the unnecessary email addresses. Pretty tedious.",1
Some of our customers have one central invoicing address with multiple delivery sites  definitely a problem we have faced when using Xero,1
"Hi Kelly, 

Can you please respond to the requests of users to have notifications for payments. When a payment is received an alert, ideally email, is sent to the user. 

This seems to be a simply implementation, and users have been asking for many years. 

Please respond. 

Thanks, 
Ryan",1
"Urgently need the ability to have multiple delivery addresses for a customer.  Have asked previously, but that thread (& the 100's of comments) seems to have disappeared!
Xero, please spend time on this rather than other updates which we don't like.",1
"Hi Kelly, Has there been any progress on this topic?  I am currently converting from MYOB to Xero and this matter could potentially stop the change over.
Our Major customers have multiple sites we service as many as 30 different locations for one customer, they require details of each site on invoices for payment approval.
MYOB gives me this flexibility at this stage, this is a critically feature which a lot of businesses need!
",1
"I've requested this several times over the last 6 years. I was told about 5 years ago it was about to be released. never happened. 
In my opinion its one of the biggest issues with Xero",1
"RemindME! 10 Years ""Has this been implemented yet?""",1
"Needs to be done, amazed its not currently possible.",1
"Really  surprised this isn't supported.  As a B2B company, our customers very frequently have different desired Ship To locations...and having that not reflect accurately in the invoice is a big impediment.  The workaround of creating a distinct Contact record for each desired shipping location is also problematic, as some of these addresses will only be used infrequently.   Please please",1
"@Benjamin Patton - this has actually been a feature request for around 7 to 9 years..... they closed their old forum and created this one, so all of the requests that have been around for years now look new. I've been using Xero for over 10 years (boss refuses to let me move to different accounts program because he thinks it would be too much time and energy, so I have learnt to suffer) and this was one of the first features i voted on years ago. It used to have hundreds of votes but this new forum is much more difficult to navigate than the last one so I'm guessing a lot of users can't find this to vote on it again... or they have just lost the will to try after so many years.... ",1
"Kelly any updates ??
MYOB has ability to do Multiple Delivery addresses 
Quickbooks has the ability to do Multiple Delivery addresses 

",1
"Yes! We have this issue where we are dealing with multiple people from the same contact record, but no way of being able to add a contact record first name, last name, email, phone and position etc ""sales""

At the moment, we have a group of phone numbers, but no way of inputting which phone number matches to which person within that contact record. This seems like a very basic functionality for this system!",1
"Hi all

We've been using a work around by changing the delivery address for accounts to match their requirements. As we add more customers, many larger than we've traditionally dealt with, this is becoming a complicated and time consuming task. Example 1 - Company group structure with single billing address and multiple manufacturing sites. Example 2 - Customer is a distributor who wants us to drop-ship orders to their various customers. Example 3 - Single company with various departments, each with individual delivery addresses.

I'm amazed when I read others' comments that this request has been pushed to one side for so long. C'mon Xero - this should be a basic feature.",1
"Personally can't believe this functionality hasn't been created given the amount of businesses that have multiple shipments locations for the same business.

customers want a statement for all stores combined and to manually type in an address each invoice just show PO's can be matched and paid is silly. Given Xero generally improves efficiency though automation rather than manual entry",1
It's frustrating when dealing with multiple contracts and departments within the same company.  Currently each contract with the same client is set up with a new debtor record with new contact details.  It makes reporting time consuming if you have to go through and add them all together to get anything meaningful around your debtors.  Other software packages can deal with it - how do they do it?  I appreciate your time in looking into this.,1
Many customers have multiple shipping addresses. It's very annoying that these cannot be stored so you can choose the shipping address for a particular order. I know that Sage allows for this and it seems crazy Xero as advanced as it is does not. Please sort it out Xero. All I can do currently is save the addresses previously used under notes for the customer.,1
"Hello Kelly,

This feature was requested over ten years ago. The recent ""upgrades"" to contacts has actually made contacts more time consuming, confusing, and difficult to use. It would be great if Xero could continue to move in the direction of making the product better without making it more difficult to use in the process.

"I have to agree with Lisa, the process for setting up a new contact or changing/updating details is a lot more complicated and time consuming than it used to be.   ",1
"To allow multiple contacts under the same company. 

Purposes: To save time changing of contact details, since some clients dealt with the same company with different people.",2
"Ability to add delivery address to quote/invoices. 

Purpose: To save time from having to edit a contact to add a street address.",2
We have various customers with multiple addresses for which we can't invoice through Xero.,2
"I use distributors, so have multiple ship-to's that I need on a purchase order.",2
We have customers that have different locations that we would like to bill them for.,2
"As a compnay we supply services to property managers but they need the invoice to go directly to their landlords, to have to create multiple contacts for all the individual properties for the same client would be really complicated and would mean we don't have a proper history for the client as all invoices would be spread across multiple contacts.",2
Ability to change the customer address on unique invoices (so not always the address of the contact),2
"Each account should be able to have a child account under its parent. I have clients with many sites under one umbrella, making it challenging to enter each site as a new customer. ",2
"Ability to access an address book when sending a quote. 

Some clients have multiple managers and the quote doesn't always go to the same person nor to accounts. Currently we have to cut and paste the email address in from another piece of software. which is quite time consuming",2
"Hi,
This is not necessarily what I require....Multiple addresses etc.
I need additional fields in contacts, so I can store Nationality, D.O.B., Gender, Food Allergy, Medication. 
This is important for some of my clients when using Xero.
Let me know as and when you develop.
Thanks
",2
"To be clear, not just ability to add multiple persons to a contact and send to all, it should allow the user to select the primary person (and email) from the list of persons associated with the contact, and optionally to select other persons from the list to copy in. ",2
"I have clients with different delivery addresses, home, office, depot etc. At the moment, I have to go to the customer detail screen, change the delivery address, create the invoice and go back to the customer screen to enter the main address again. My old system allowed multiple delivery addresses from a dropdown box. This was a sensible solution.",2
"We sell to big corporates and universities. A big university has departments all over town and sometimes the country, but all with the same tax details. Currently, we must create a different account for each. 
We also synchronise with Capsule CRM, which then means different customers for the same university or even the same person! This gets messy very quickly. Please allow multiple invoice addresses within one account.",2
Also be able to have two (or more) contacts with the same name but different details.  Need the system to assist here,2
"Being able to select email addresses when sending a quote or invoice, as these would normally go to different people of the same company.
Maybe having an accounts option in contacts for email address when sending invoices/statements. 
",2
"We also deal with multiple contacts within a single company so we need to be able to send quotes to different people, invoices go again to different contacts and then there are multiple delivery addresses/contacts as well.

For us it is important to be able to manage multiple contacts for different functions within the same company.",2
"I have a customer that drop ships to all of his customers. I need the ability to charge the primary customer, but print a packing slip with different addresses.",2
Yes I need this function very important.,2
Please please please update so I can add multiple persons & details to a single contact record. I have to invoice an individual contract c/- one management company.,2
basic feature I imagine most businesses would need,2
Being able to create your own field in contacts would be great!  We pay a lot of our vendors by Zelle and would like to keep their email or phone # that is connected to their zelle account which maybe different than their business email or phone #.  Or just have a general Notes section so we can input notes we would like to see when looking at vendor.,3
"Sub account is something quickbook has and it works great for multiple retail locations under 1 parent HQ or 1 MNC with multiple departments.

It should be an easy implementation and hope Xero can do this asap!",3
Thank you for the update Kelly as we are needing this feature for our business. It would be good if the multiple delivery address synced with Workflowmax too.,3
"Hi Kelly, it's great you are working on this. 

I'm frustrated by the restriction of address fields to 2 only.

Below is my recent email to your support team.

We have many customers with more than 2 addresses, as below

1) Shop address
2) warehouse address
3) Billing address

However we are only able to add 2 addresses to the Contact Details page, which means valuable information is missing from their Contact records.

Can you please add an extra address field into the Contact Details Section?",3
"Also NEED this feature. Please add ASAP, Xero. Thanks!",3
This is critical for my newest client.  Raised this issue years ago.  Hopefully with new invoicing it might actually happen,3
"I switched from Sage to Xero because I find Xero more straightforward and user-friendly. However, Sage offers more features, like the ability to assign multiple shipping addresses to a single contact. This is important for me because I have clients with multiple branches, and my driver often gets confused about the correct delivery address. I currently have to handwrite the address on the delivery slip, which is time-consuming.",3
"I transitioned from Sage to Xero a few years ago, largely because Xero was ahead of the curve in many areas. However, the lack of support for multiple addresses under a single contact record has been a significant pain point for my business. Sage handled this feature very well, and it’s disappointing that Xero doesn’t yet offer a comparable solution. 

For example, we work with a client that requires individual invoices for numerous delivery sites. Currently, having to place the delivery address in the reference field is cumbersome and unprofessional. This feels like a fundamental feature that should already be in place.  

I understand the complexity of implementing such a solution, but it’s vital for businesses like mine. While this enhancement might not bring immediate revenue, it will undoubtedly help retain your loyal customers and improve user satisfaction.

"Hi there,
Just wondering if there is an update on the roll out of multiple delivery addresses for one Contact? Thank you 🙏 ",3
This would be very helpful because if I work with a contractor I want to keep track how much he owes me even if it distributed with multiple addresses. Here is a example of how we do this is on our scheduling system.,3
that is a good thing. For my company i deal with builders that have multiple locations .  so that would be very helpful for me.   they know what invoice goes to what location.,3
"Thanks for the update Kelly, this is a step in the right direction. The new fields in the contact record are easy to find.",3
This beta version is working well for us. It's certainly better than the old workaround of creating duplicate contacts.,3
Glad to see this is finally being addressed. The ability to select a different address on the invoice screen helps our workflow.,3
Appreciate the communication on this. It looks like the new feature will cover our needs for clients with multiple branches.,3
Good to see this on the roadmap. It will be helpful for our construction clients who move sites frequently.,3
Thanks Xero team. Tested the new function today and it seems stable. Definitely saves a bit of admin time.,3
This is a solid improvement. Being able to add a secondary address for delivery without editing the main contact is useful.,3
Much appreciated update. It makes the statement run much cleaner now that we don't have split accounts.,3
"Hi Kelly, thanks for the fix. It handles the 'Ship To' requirement well enough for our smaller clients.",3
"Kelly, Thats music to my years...can you please add me to the contact list when this features is available.
We are a wholesaler and send fabric to customers who have multiple address for their 1. designers who may be working remotely[ more often , these days] . Their 2. bulk warehouse where the contact holds goods for future processing. 3.Fabric cutters who are a different company 4. Overseas destinations.
We currently have to put these address into Xero as a Item so that the information as already in the system and data entry mistakes aren't made but it is a bit crazy esp when the rudimentary Xero reports will include the Item in reports that then make the report meaningless or just inaccurate for mamangement information.

"Great to hear that this basic (on the face of it) functionality is being implemented, it needs to be done thanks.",4
Thank you for the update Kelly! Can't wait to see how the feature functions.,4
"Hope to see the solution live soon. It's a common feature in all software.
Thank you for your speedily work on it to solve it.

Thank you",4
"Hey Kelly, thank you for the updates. We appreciate you!

Is there a quarter on your roadmap for when this feature has been allocated to?

Also, just checking if this also means that the address selected for an invoice will persist with that invoice, even after a contact adds a new address in the future?",4
Great Idea,4
"Building on this request, it would also be extremely helpful to have the ability to choose which linked person under a single business contact is used when creating quotes or invoices. Many businesses work with multiple individuals at the same company, and being able to select the correct person (rather than defaulting to the primary contact) would greatly improve accuracy and tracking.",4
Finally! This is a total game changer for our wholesale business. Thank you!,4
Love this update! Saved me hours of data entry this week alone. Brilliant work.,4
Thank you Xero! This makes managing our retail clients with 50+ stores so much easier.,4
YES! FINALLY!!!! I have been using my own custom made template for this for ages - seems crazy to send a client a statement with 10+ outstanding invoices on it and expect them to open each invoice and click the links separately...! this pay now feature is well overdue. thank you Xero! I am v sad I didn't get to try it out though... hopefully in the next pool??!,4
This is huge for us. Our dispatch team is celebrating not having to check addresses manually!,4

Game changer for our construction projects. Invoicing for different sites is a breeze now.,4
The ability to save unlimited addresses per contact is amazing. Thank you so much!,4

I'm really looking forward to what you guys come up with.

Thank goodness! No more manual typing on packing slips. You are a life saver.,4
This is a massive improvement. It makes Xero the best option on the market again.,4
Huge relief to have this sorted. Invoicing is actually fast again. 10/10 update.,4
