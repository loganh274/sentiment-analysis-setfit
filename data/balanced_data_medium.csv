Whilst I continue to use Xero I do not recommend it to others. In fact I disrecommend it. Customer focus and response is very poor. This particular topic has dragged on for years.,0
This is incredibly important... it is time consuming when Xero is supposed to be making our lives easier!,0
"I currently have a free trial, I like the look of xero over competition at present, but This is looking ot be a deal breaker.",0
I see the flashy ads and advertising at sporting events and think if Xero only spent more money on basic product features they would get so many more customers just by 'word of mouth'. Currently I advise any business contacts I have to avoid Xero like the plague. :-(,0
If classic invoicing is retired on the 27th without new invoicing being fixed... then i'm leaving and taking my orgs somewhere else (that will be 4 orgs),0
Please don't succumb to inshitification now that you have captured the market...,0
"How is this feature taking so long to implement?! It's really very critical for any business which provides physical goods... Please Xero, listen to your customers, Just. Get. It. Sorted.",0
Nah not 3 years. I requested this back 10 years ago minimum. They just keep changing the forums and merging and changing the date so it doesn't look like it's been so long.,0
This should be a no brainer!!!! This would save your users a lot of time and frustration. Makes me want to go back to MYOB,0
"As my mum used to say : ""You've got 2 hopes - Bob Hope and No Hope!"". lol",0
"Having read Xero's poor stance on support of such a significantly key feature, has resulted in my firm deciding to migrate from Xero to Sage.",0
"Sorry Xero, it was good while it lasted, maybe losing customers to a competitor might finally spur you into listening to your customer base more.",0
We kept switching back to the classic invoicing and didn't realise this feature was unavailable until now! Very annoying... or we may look at switching companies too!,0
This was announced that you would be reverting the payroll pricing in December 2024 yet here we are in April 2025 and still no update on this. That is a lot of money people have practically wasted waiting on this being corrected.,0
To say this is not in your future plans is simply LAZY and CONCEITED!,0
Another disbelief from me that this is not incorporated. Pull the finger out Xero,0
"MARCH 2023 last update, how about another one! ... I am still in my trial period and will not be purchasing.",0
We will not jump on-board till this issue is addressed,0
"I guess Xero does not want to improve their software. What a waste of .... talent, time, money....everything about on this software.",0
The lack of this feature alone is enough to consider an alternative software package.,0
"Lisa Diamond- Welcome to Xero product ideas, where important product feature requests go to die. Or just ignored for decades. It's been over THIRTEEN years Xero seriously!!",0
"It's just absurd that, in the new and ""improved"" invoicing system does not include a way to allocate the whole invoice to a category and/or project!",0
If I had known that Xero didn't have this basic functionality I would have gone with a different program. As soon as I find a better program I'm switching,0
"I think Xero is pathetic in this area, as every other decent accounting package has this as standard in such as RECKON, MYOB, QUICKBOOKS and many more.",0
Agree with Benjamin on 16.08.22 - this is such a basic feature. Time to move a batch of clients back to Sage - hugely embarrassing and a complete waste of time.,0
So... our pathetic solution is to create multiple accounts for the same client but add a full stop or 2 to their name. Disgusting solution,0
March 2025 We just change from QuickBooks to Xero and this simple feature is so important to our operation we are considering switching back.,0
I do not accept that a company the size of Xero with all of the IT specialists and technicians it employs can't find a way to resolve this quickly if the will to do so exists.,0
We too have stopped recommending Xero and are actively looking for an alternative.,0
"That is a lot of political cover up in my opinion... I will stick with Classic until it dies - but must say Xero, users are not happy",0
"I cannot believe this feature is still not live! We got suckered in by the marketing claims from Xero... Xero does not care about implementing multiple contacts, as long as people are still paying!!",0
"Not only is there no progress, but there is no feedback from Xero who seem to be holding their clients in complete contempt.",0
The years are rolling by and not only has it not been done. There is also no response. I’m looking to leave on this.,0
Completely agree with Kim and William on this one - the deafening silence from Xero is shocking.,0
"I'd say Do Better Xero, but why would I bother?!",0
Hi Kelly when CLASSIC was RETIRED it wasn't blown to smithereens — was it? ... No-one cares that they gave it a red hot go and it didn't work... don't keep flogging this dead horse,0
"Again I like to voice my frustration about Xero's present ""simple"" address management... once a quote is accepted it should never change.",0
"Urgently need the ability to have multiple delivery addresses for a customer. Have asked previously, but that thread (& the 100's of comments) seems to have disappeared!",0
"Greg, I totally agree with you. Regretting moving from Reckon Desktop. Xero has created twice as much work for me, without the basic functionality that even Open Source packages have.",0
"Stop telling me you are listening, if you were we would be using Classic Invoicing this morning.",0
I am really surprised there are not notifications to approvers when an invoice awaits approval. It means someone has to contact me outside the system... I expected the feature to exist.,1
"Hi Kelly, It has now been a year since this update - where is this solution at now? We are looking at moving from MYOB but this is CRITICAL to our operations",1
"Now 13 years later, this is still not implemented. Xero must have the resources to fix this.",1
Is there any update on this please? I have a client wanting to change software but they won't use Xero unless this key feature is in place.,1
Any update ????????,1
"Yes still waiting - but they will spend time changing the sales invoices into a way we don’t want them for no reason, but ignore the points that actually need to be worked on like this!",1
I am so disappointed that Xero missed this function.... All people here in Australia working in the healthcare industry need it.,1
"Hi Xero Team, Not long to go now before the 12 month anniversary of your post made on the 30th April 2024... Where are we at?",1
GoCardless is probably one of the worst payment gateways... Why is Xero even in partnership with a payment gateway with such horrid customer service?,1
Lol - it is clear that Xero ignores this chat. The feature would be excellent. Maybe someone should start the chat on LinkedIn; it may garner some attention...,1
"As a new user of Xero, I'm surprised that what I thought would be a standard feature of accounting software isn't available; yet the issue has been highlighted by so many people, over many years.",1
Please see attached email detailing how SAGE invoicing is better as it has more fields. Had we understood the Xero limitations here we may not have moved to Xero.,1
Thank you for raising this. Yes it is very frustrating having to navigate to My Xero all the time. Please bring this search feature back.,1
When are you going to fix the issue with invoice numbering? I'm sick of having to manually determine what the last invoice number was...,1
"This should be straightforward for a professional development team, especially since you already have the same function active on another page.",1
Please please can this 2nd reference field be added to Bills soon! Duplicate payments have been made because of this oversight. 10 years of asking and counting.... please....,1
"Now everything is click, click, click, click, click, click. So inefficient.",1
"Hi Kelly, any update? As other posters point out, Sage and QuickBooks have this basic feature as standard.",1
"Can all those here who really would benefit from this idea, bombard this page with this request so maybe then XERO will take some action!",1
"This shouldn't be optional or subject to ""interest"". A middle name is a legal piece of information required for income tax returns.",1
"This feature would be a great addition to Xero and a feature that everyone seems to be crying for!! Our Xero subscriptions goes up constantly, yet no new features to prove its worth!",1
"Tjaart, I feel your pain, and now this morning I got an e-mail that Xero is retiring Pay Runs for global customers. Without providing alternative.",1
Can you please update your software to include matching credit notes when matching invoices to bank payments. Having to allocate the credit notes separately is so time consuming and annoying.,1
Lack of Xero 2 xero is the only reason I haven't switched to new invoicing. Disappointing I'll lose access to it next week,1
"It seems email notifications has been introduced with no way to turn them off. For some, I am sure, very useful for everyone else a nightmare of unwanted spam.",1
"Because I can't create an invoice that calculates quantity, price, and number of months (custom field), I have to create invoices manually for some services.",1
This has been ongoing for some time. What sort of timescale are we talking Xero.,1
"Been waiting 15 years for this. In that time, Xero have brought in plenty of upgrades, but not this one simple feature.",1
This is a must release feature in my opinion,1
"Hi Kelly, We're a certified app partner and I must say this is the most commonly asked questions by our users... Couple of days of dev work would save you a lot of customers going to Quickbooks",1
"Why does XERO autofill the ""payment date"" to some weird date? ... Xero should not autofill the payment date but leave it blank for us to fill in.",1
Another month-end with more incorrect VAT rates on invoices going out to clients - this is so frustrating and not something that we had problems with previously!,1
"Omg Xero, why don't you understand requests properly???! ... Why does Xero make changes that affect everyone on requests with only 38 votes..?",1
Come on Xero - you tick the boxes in so many ways but this function is a standard requirement for all business - not just those who take the time to contact you about it.,1
I totally agree with Joana. It appears that I will have to move to Xero Ultimate just to run a payroll for 6 people?,1
All other systems can record 2 reference numbers... Ridiculous that only one reference field is available.,1
@Kelly Munro is there any update on this? I just read through the new invoicing features being released and this is nowhere to be found.,1
Is there any update on how long this will take? We have a serious delay in one of our big clients supporting xero currently due to this nog being a functionality yet.,1
It has actually been over 10 years since this feature was requested. No update as to when this could be added...,1
They're VERY busy working on SUPER important updates... like changing the appearance of the invoicing UI for absolutely ZERO benefit to actual bookkeepers...,1
Would be helpful if you had the ability to change the dashboard graphs to show YTD as well.,2
"I have xero integrated with my capsule crm and would like for xero to have the multiple addresses, so it can sync correctly when identifying and updating.",2
A classic important detail: Most of our customers have a contract address which is different to the invoice address. So this is really needed.,2
"QB has this feature in their payrun, it makes it superfast and easy to process for payday super",2
Critical need for us too - Date and period should be separate fields/options in the system - it's the only way to enable accurate reporting.,2
"Very critical for SMEs in Singapore. Please add more email addresses. Currently, the maximum is 10 only for Quote and invoice",2
"Yes! At the moment we can filter by staff member but they're not even in date order. Filter by date, filter by supplier within each staff member would be common sense.",2
"If we can have the option of choosing the delivery address from a drop down list, it will be great.",2
"Pleased to see some bulk changes can now be made on the Job Manager table, hopefully the ability to change the job status this way is not far off as it would be so useful for us.",2
We often receive order's from one customer(partner) but deliver is to a difference customer(partners Customer) how can do this in Zero?,2
"Hugely important, getting to work with big clients with multiple cost centres is tough enough, having to then figure things out in Xero and getting paid needs to be easy.",2
Wow I didn't know. Where do I find history and notes?,2
Agreed with all. Please add an option to opt out of email notification. Thank you!,2
"This would be super helpful for our business as well. Our terms are broken up to in 3 payments 30% deposity, 30% at installation and 40% at completion.",2
Agreed. How has this not been implemented yet. Seem's like such a basic fix.,2
This would be great,2
Michelle - potential work around... Make up a draft invoice (or draft quote) that can be easily copied to create a new invoice.,2
Really helpful to have a customer field for how to present an invoice.,2
Each ABN is a separate legal entity so can only belong to one Xero file.,2
"Great news, but saying that you can't give ""specifics on a timeline"" feels like a deflection.",2
"many of our customers are large organizations (like universities). While all the bills for invoices to different departments are paid by the university, we invoice the individual departments separately",2
Auditors frequently ask for this information.,2
Is there an update on this please?,2
Very Critical,2
Note: This seems to vary between Users as for myself every time log off (or get logged off) reopens with only three Organisations and no Search function,2
"Please add a way to calculate, itemise WET for invoices and make it easy to lodge BAS! It's critical for our business.",2
The '.' still does not seem to work in the invoice date field? The '/' works fine.,2
"To me, this is a crucial matter because I need to send invoices to numerous departments at the same company, each with its own unique contact person and email address.",2
I have contacts with more than 5 addresses! Please add this feature!,2
YES! We so need to do this. Xero contacts is fine when your client is an individual with two residential addresses but when your main client is a corporate...,2
Make new invoicing fit on one screen - currently classic fits on one screen and is easy to use.,2
I want to be able to add phone numbers for the extra contacts.,2
"It seems inconceivable that you have to enter a separate budget for each tracking category, and then have to undertake a manual exercise to ensure that they reconcile...",2
Small group of companies. Parent company and 4 subsidiaries with very similar structure and in the same business. Need to report on consolidated (combined) performance,2
"As a compnay we supply services to property managers but they need the invoice to go directly to their landlords, to have to create multiple contacts...",2
"Hi there, please make this available in WorkFlow Max also. Also an address book function so you do not have to add the same contacts manually against different clients.",2
"Hi Kelly, Please confirm when we can expect this important update on a single contact with multiple delivery addresses.",2
"Hi, Could we have another box next to reference in suppliers invoices for purchase orders, as the moment we are using reference for invoice number",2
This is a major issue and time waster for us. Especially when you have a large group to close.,2
It is essential for us to be able to spread the cost of an annual bill thoughout the year. We receive many invoices annually / quarterly and this would save a lot of time.,2
Thank you :) This will make the finalisation of deceased estates and vesting of trusts so much easier.,3
This looks promising. It handles the basic requirement of separate shipping addresses well.,3
"https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/xero-navigation/... Above Chrome extension could help with the Xero navigation, feel free to use and suggestions are welcome.",3
It’s a decent update. The drop-down menu on the new invoicing screen is handy and works as expected.,3
I think xero isn’t really aimed at larger companies with lots of transactions. I suggest moving to another provider who does this better.,3
"Jodi Herbein, Yes, I checked it. And the payment terms were applied correctly! However, the warning pop-up window is still there.",3
Some really good points here from @SamBond... I would strongly recommend using the xero api to address these needs.,3
@Kelly. Great news. Question - will multiple 'client' email addresses flow through to tax payments module to issue tax payment letters for multiple recipients...,3
This is a solid improvement. Being able to add a secondary address for delivery without editing the main contact is useful.,3
"I transitioned from Sage to Xero a few years ago, largely because Xero was ahead of the curve in many areas.",3
Sub account is something quickbook has and it works great for multiple retail locations under 1 parent HQ or 1 MNC with multiple departments.,3
Glad to see this is finally being addressed. The ability to select a different address on the invoice screen helps our workflow.,3
"I switched from Sage to Xero because I find Xero more straightforward and user-friendly. However, Sage offers more features...",3
Good to see this on the roadmap. It will be helpful for our construction clients who move sites frequently.,3
This beta version is working well for us. It's certainly better than the old workaround of creating duplicate contacts.,3
"Yes, Leila Rubner-Petersen, But Quackbooks is terrible in all other respects, so I would rather stick with not being able to reconcile properly in Xero :)",3
Being able to create your own field in contacts would be great! We pay a lot of our vendors by Zelle and would like to keep their email or phone #,3
Thanks Kelly. This update makes Xero much more competitive against Sage for inventory businesses.,3
Appreciate the communication on this. It looks like the new feature will cover our needs for clients with multiple branches.,3
Appreciate getting this sorted. It makes matching the delivery docket to the invoice much simpler.,3
"Thanks for the update Kelly, this is a step in the right direction. The new fields in the contact record are easy to find.",3
"Never mind, found it. That is perfect thank you",3
"Also NEED this feature. Please add ASAP, Xero. Thanks!",3
"I agree this is an issue that needs to be solved for all of us. That being said, as a Xero user, I feel we should keep our comments to what is needed to better the software.",3
"Very often we missed the bills and invoices. It requires to be in Xero for me to be able to process pending bills. I’m always on the go (travel), notifications would be awesome",3
The integration with the new invoicing layout seems to be working okay. A helpful feature.,3
"Hi there, Just wondering if there is an update on the roll out of multiple delivery addresses for one Contact? Thank you 🙏",3
that is a good thing. For my company i deal with builders that have multiple locations . so that would be very helpful for me.,3
Great to hear this will be released soon.,3
"Can't believe I jsut switched 2 businesses over to Xero just to find out that this ESSENTIAL feature is non-existent. Such an big let down, their customer service has been great...",3
It was great to also hear at Xerocon that the deposit feature is being developed. In the mean time I'm finding Xero Projects a good way to link together multiple invoices,3
Thanks for the work on this. It’s going to make tracking shipments to different franchises easier.,3
Thanks Xero team. Tested the new function today and it seems stable. Definitely saves a bit of admin time.,3
"The multiple address option is easy enough to navigate. Good update, thanks for listening.",3
Great idea!,3
"Good that future company returns can be done, but surely it isnt that hard to build one for trusts and partnerships too?",3
Totally agree with this. Would be really useful.,3
Happy to see this released. It cuts down on the manual copy-pasting we were doing from our CRM.,3
"Hi Everyone, I also urgently need this feature building in as standard. I love Xero but my client is less than convinced due to this missing multiple delivery address feature.",3
"Hi Kelly, it's great you are working on this. I'm frustrated by the restriction of address fields to 2 only.",3
YES! FINALLY!!!! I have been using my own custom made template for this for ages... this pay now feature is well overdue. thank you Xero!,4
This is huge for us. Our dispatch team is celebrating not having to check addresses manually!,4
"Kelly, Thats music to my years...can you please add me to the contact list when this features is available.",4
Hope to see the solution live soon. It's a common feature in all software. Thank you for your speedily work on it to solve it.,4
Game changer for our construction projects. Invoicing for different sites is a breeze now.,4
The ability to save unlimited addresses per contact is amazing. Thank you so much!,4
This is exactly what I wanted to see from xero especially with the price increases. Please let me know if I can help guinea pig ;-),4
Thank goodness! No more manual typing on packing slips. You are a life saver.,4
This is a massive improvement. It makes Xero the best option on the market again.,4
This is fantastic such a time saver!! Are there any plans to implement this in bills as well?,4
Love this update! Saved me hours of data entry this week alone. Brilliant work.,4
Thank you for the update Kelly! Can't wait to see how the feature functions.,4
So happy with this. It cleans up my contacts list instantly. No more duplicate names!,4
Just tested the multiple shipping addresses and it's brilliant. Well done dev team.,4
Thank you Xero! This worked today!!!! What a relief to have this feature back.,4
Yesss! I can finally ditch the spreadsheet workaround. This is amazing.,4
"Best update in years. Seriously, thank you for listening to us and getting this done!",4
Great Idea,4
Thank you Xero! This makes managing our retail clients with 50+ stores so much easier.,4
"Great to hear that this basic (on the face of it) functionality is being implemented, it needs to be done thanks.",4
Essential feature delivered! This is why we stay with Xero. Fantastic work.,4
Fantastic work on this release. It's solved our biggest headache overnight.,4
Love this! So many small businesses come to me after having done this and it is a mess!,4
Finally! I've been waiting for this for years and it works exactly like I hoped. Thank you!,4
Finally we can send to different branches without the headache! Thank you Kelly and team!,4
Brilliant! I can select the specific site address right from the invoice drop-down. Love it.,4
Awesome!,4
This is exactly what we needed! MYOB didn't even do it this smoothly. Great job.,4
Absolutely love the new functionality. It's intuitive and just works exactly how it should.,4
Where did you hear that's it's being implemented? It would be great news if it is.,4
Fantastic to see this has now been released onto at least one of my clients!!!,4
This is fantastic news. The multiple delivery address feature works perfectly and is super fast.,4
Finally! This is a total game changer for our wholesale business. Thank you!,4
Thanks so much :-),4
"Building on this request, it would also be extremely helpful to have the ability to choose which linked person under a single business contact is used...",4
"Love it, love it, love it. No more messy workarounds or using the reference field!",4
"Hey Kelly, thank you for the updates. We appreciate you!",4
"Wow, what a difference. This was the one thing missing and now it's perfect.",4
This feature is incredible. It handles our multi-site customers with ease. Thank you!,4
YES! FINALLY!!!! I have been using my own custom made template for this for ages...,4
