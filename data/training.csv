"I have xero integrated with my capsule crm and would like for xero to have the multiple addresses, so it can sync correctly when identifying and updating.",2
"I guess Xero does not want to improve their software. What a waste of .... talent, time, money....everything about on this software.",0
I totally agree with Joana. It appears that I will have to move to Xero Ultimate just to run a payroll for 6 people?,1
Lack of Xero 2 xero is the only reason I haven't switched to new invoicing. Disappointing I'll lose access to it next week,1
It is essential for us to be able to spread the cost of an annual bill thoughout the year. We receive many invoices annually / quarterly and this would save a lot of time.,2
Totally agree with this. Would be really useful.,3
Great idea!,3
This is a solid improvement. Being able to add a secondary address for delivery without editing the main contact is useful.,3
"Having read Xero's poor stance on support of such a significantly key feature, has resulted in my firm deciding to migrate from Xero to Sage.",0
"many of our customers are large organizations (like universities). While all the bills for invoices to different departments are paid by the university, we invoice the individual departments separately",2
This feature is incredible. It handles our multi-site customers with ease. Thank you!,4
This is huge for us. Our dispatch team is celebrating not having to check addresses manually!,4
Great Idea,4
This is a massive improvement. It makes Xero the best option on the market again.,4

Fantastic work on this release. It's solved our biggest headache overnight.,4
that is a good thing. For my company i deal with builders that have multiple locations . so that would be very helpful for me.,3
"It's just absurd that, in the new and ""improved"" invoicing system does not include a way to allocate the whole invoice to a category and/or project!",0

"It's just absurd that, in the new and ""improved"" invoicing system does not include a way to allocate the whole invoice to a category and/or project!",0
"Building on this request, it would also be extremely helpful to have the ability to choose which linked person under a single business contact is used...",4
"Urgently need the ability to have multiple delivery addresses for a customer. Have asked previously, but that thread (& the 100's of comments) seems to have disappeared!",0
A classic important detail: Most of our customers have a contract address which is different to the invoice address. So this is really needed.,2
"Hi Kelly, We're a certified app partner and I must say this is the most commonly asked questions by our users... Couple of days of dev work would save you a lot of customers going to Quickbooks",1
"Hi there, Just wondering if there is an update on the roll out of multiple delivery addresses for one Contact? Thank you 🙏",3
"How is this feature taking so long to implement?! It's really very critical for any business which provides physical goods... Please Xero, listen to your customers, Just. Get. It. Sorted.",0
It has actually been over 10 years since this feature was requested. No update as to when this could be added...,1
"I think Xero is pathetic in this area, as every other decent accounting package has this as standard in such as RECKON, MYOB, QUICKBOOKS and many more.",0
"I currently have a free trial, I like the look of xero over competition at present, but This is looking ot be a deal breaker.",0
"I have xero integrated with my capsule crm and would like for xero to have the multiple addresses, so it can sync correctly when identifying and updating.",2
Absolutely love the new functionality. It's intuitive and just works exactly how it should.,4
"Lisa Diamond- Welcome to Xero product ideas, where important product feature requests go to die. Or just ignored for decades. It's been over THIRTEEN years Xero seriously!!",0
"Please add a way to calculate, itemise WET for invoices and make it easy to lodge BAS! It's critical for our business.",2
"Wow, what a difference. This was the one thing missing and now it's perfect.",4
Agree with Benjamin on 16.08.22 - this is such a basic feature. Time to move a batch of clients back to Sage - hugely embarrassing and a complete waste of time.,0
"Hi there, please make this available in WorkFlow Max also. Also an address book function so you do not have to add the same contacts manually against different clients.",2
"That is a lot of political cover up in my opinion... I will stick with Classic until it dies - but must say Xero, users are not happy",0
@Kelly. Great news. Question - will multiple 'client' email addresses flow through to tax payments module to issue tax payment letters for multiple recipients...,3
"https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/xero-navigation/... Above Chrome extension could help with the Xero navigation, feel free to use and suggestions are welcome.",3
Sub account is something quickbook has and it works great for multiple retail locations under 1 parent HQ or 1 MNC with multiple departments.,3
YES! We so need to do this. Xero contacts is fine when your client is an individual with two residential addresses but when your main client is a corporate...,2
"Hi Xero Team, Not long to go now before the 12 month anniversary of your post made on the 30th April 2024... Where are we at?",1
"Hugely important, getting to work with big clients with multiple cost centres is tough enough, having to then figure things out in Xero and getting paid needs to be easy.",2
"Hi Everyone, I also urgently need this feature building in as standard. I love Xero but my client is less than convinced due to this missing multiple delivery address feature.",3
Finally! This is a total game changer for our wholesale business. Thank you!,4
This is incredibly important... it is time consuming when Xero is supposed to be making our lives easier!,0
"If we can have the option of choosing the delivery address from a drop down list, it will be great.",2
Is there any update on how long this will take? We have a serious delay in one of our big clients supporting xero currently due to this nog being a functionality yet.,1
Glad to see this is finally being addressed. The ability to select a different address on the invoice screen helps our workflow.,3
Agree with Benjamin on 16.08.22 - this is such a basic feature. Time to move a batch of clients back to Sage - hugely embarrassing and a complete waste of time.,0
"Yes! At the moment we can filter by staff member but they're not even in date order. Filter by date, filter by supplier within each staff member would be common sense.",2
Finally we can send to different branches without the headache! Thank you Kelly and team!,4
Finally we can send to different branches without the headache! Thank you Kelly and team!,4
"Hi, Could we have another box next to reference in suppliers invoices for purchase orders, as the moment we are using reference for invoice number",2
Really helpful to have a customer field for how to present an invoice.,2
"Hi Kelly, It has now been a year since this update - where is this solution at now? We are looking at moving from MYOB but this is CRITICAL to our operations",1
Finally! I've been waiting for this for years and it works exactly like I hoped. Thank you!,4
"Thanks for the update Kelly, this is a step in the right direction. The new fields in the contact record are easy to find.",3
"Can't believe I jsut switched 2 businesses over to Xero just to find out that this ESSENTIAL feature is non-existent. Such an big let down, their customer service has been great...",3
Thank you Xero! This worked today!!!! What a relief to have this feature back.,4
Essential feature delivered! This is why we stay with Xero. Fantastic work.,4
Appreciate the communication on this. It looks like the new feature will cover our needs for clients with multiple branches.,3
Very Critical,2
GoCardless is probably one of the worst payment gateways... Why is Xero even in partnership with a payment gateway with such horrid customer service?,1
Note: This seems to vary between Users as for myself every time log off (or get logged off) reopens with only three Organisations and no Search function,2
"I agree this is an issue that needs to be solved for all of us. That being said, as a Xero user, I feel we should keep our comments to what is needed to better the software.",3
This is exactly what I wanted to see from xero especially with the price increases. Please let me know if I can help guinea pig ;-),4
"Hugely important, getting to work with big clients with multiple cost centres is tough enough, having to then figure things out in Xero and getting paid needs to be easy.",2
Thanks Xero team. Tested the new function today and it seems stable. Definitely saves a bit of admin time.,3
This is a massive improvement. It makes Xero the best option on the market again.,4
Please see attached email detailing how SAGE invoicing is better as it has more fields. Had we understood the Xero limitations here we may not have moved to Xero.,1
Sub account is something quickbook has and it works great for multiple retail locations under 1 parent HQ or 1 MNC with multiple departments.,3
Auditors frequently ask for this information.,2
"It seems email notifications has been introduced with no way to turn them off. For some, I am sure, very useful for everyone else a nightmare of unwanted spam.",1
Hope to see the solution live soon. It's a common feature in all software. Thank you for your speedily work on it to solve it.,4
I am so disappointed that Xero missed this function.... All people here in Australia working in the healthcare industry need it.,1
To say this is not in your future plans is simply LAZY and CONCEITED!,0
The '.' still does not seem to work in the invoice date field? The '/' works fine.,2
"This should be straightforward for a professional development team, especially since you already have the same function active on another page.",1
"Hi Kelly, any update? As other posters point out, Sage and QuickBooks have this basic feature as standard.",1
"Greg, I totally agree with you. Regretting moving from Reckon Desktop. Xero has created twice as much work for me, without the basic functionality that even Open Source packages have.",0
"Can all those here who really would benefit from this idea, bombard this page with this request so maybe then XERO will take some action!",1
Thanks Kelly. This update makes Xero much more competitive against Sage for inventory businesses.,3
"Hey Kelly, thank you for the updates. We appreciate you!",4
This looks promising. It handles the basic requirement of separate shipping addresses well.,3
"Tjaart, I feel your pain, and now this morning I got an e-mail that Xero is retiring Pay Runs for global customers. Without providing alternative.",1
"Pleased to see some bulk changes can now be made on the Job Manager table, hopefully the ability to change the job status this way is not far off as it would be so useful for us.",2
Auditors frequently ask for this information.,2
Finally! I've been waiting for this for years and it works exactly like I hoped. Thank you!,4
"This would be super helpful for our business as well. Our terms are broken up to in 3 payments 30% deposity, 30% at installation and 40% at completion.",2
"Again I like to voice my frustration about Xero's present ""simple"" address management... once a quote is accepted it should never change.",0
"Stop telling me you are listening, if you were we would be using Classic Invoicing this morning.",0
"Greg, I totally agree with you. Regretting moving from Reckon Desktop. Xero has created twice as much work for me, without the basic functionality that even Open Source packages have.",0
Another disbelief from me that this is not incorporated. Pull the finger out Xero,0
This is incredibly important... it is time consuming when Xero is supposed to be making our lives easier!,0
Where did you hear that's it's being implemented? It would be great news if it is.,4
The years are rolling by and not only has it not been done. There is also no response. I’m looking to leave on this.,0
"This shouldn't be optional or subject to ""interest"". A middle name is a legal piece of information required for income tax returns.",1
YES! FINALLY!!!! I have been using my own custom made template for this for ages...,4
I have contacts with more than 5 addresses! Please add this feature!,2
This is a must release feature in my opinion,1
I am so disappointed that Xero missed this function.... All people here in Australia working in the healthcare industry need it.,1
"Great news, but saying that you can't give ""specifics on a timeline"" feels like a deflection.",2
Being able to create your own field in contacts would be great! We pay a lot of our vendors by Zelle and would like to keep their email or phone #,3
This has been ongoing for some time. What sort of timescale are we talking Xero.,1
So... our pathetic solution is to create multiple accounts for the same client but add a full stop or 2 to their name. Disgusting solution,0
Very Critical,2
This beta version is working well for us. It's certainly better than the old workaround of creating duplicate contacts.,3
Please please can this 2nd reference field be added to Bills soon! Duplicate payments have been made because of this oversight. 10 years of asking and counting.... please....,1
"As a compnay we supply services to property managers but they need the invoice to go directly to their landlords, to have to create multiple contacts...",2
March 2025 We just change from QuickBooks to Xero and this simple feature is so important to our operation we are considering switching back.,0
Brilliant! I can select the specific site address right from the invoice drop-down. Love it.,4

"Greg, I totally agree with you. Regretting moving from Reckon Desktop. Xero has created twice as much work for me, without the basic functionality that even Open Source packages have.",0
To say this is not in your future plans is simply LAZY and CONCEITED!,0
"Been waiting 15 years for this. In that time, Xero have brought in plenty of upgrades, but not this one simple feature.",1
Nah not 3 years. I requested this back 10 years ago minimum. They just keep changing the forums and merging and changing the date so it doesn't look like it's been so long.,0
This is a major issue and time waster for us. Especially when you have a large group to close.,2
"To me, this is a crucial matter because I need to send invoices to numerous departments at the same company, each with its own unique contact person and email address.",2
"Hi Everyone, I also urgently need this feature building in as standard. I love Xero but my client is less than convinced due to this missing multiple delivery address feature.",3

It has actually been over 10 years since this feature was requested. No update as to when this could be added...,1
"Very often we missed the bills and invoices. It requires to be in Xero for me to be able to process pending bills. I’m always on the go (travel), notifications would be awesome",3
Some really good points here from @SamBond... I would strongly recommend using the xero api to address these needs.,3
When are you going to fix the issue with invoice numbering? I'm sick of having to manually determine what the last invoice number was...,1
We will not jump on-board till this issue is addressed,0
All other systems can record 2 reference numbers... Ridiculous that only one reference field is available.,1
"Hi Kelly, it's great you are working on this. I'm frustrated by the restriction of address fields to 2 only.",3
"This would be super helpful for our business as well. Our terms are broken up to in 3 payments 30% deposity, 30% at installation and 40% at completion.",2
Hi Kelly when CLASSIC was RETIRED it wasn't blown to smithereens — was it? ... No-one cares that they gave it a red hot go and it didn't work... don't keep flogging this dead horse,0
This is exactly what we needed! MYOB didn't even do it this smoothly. Great job.,4
Good to see this on the roadmap. It will be helpful for our construction clients who move sites frequently.,3
I do not accept that a company the size of Xero with all of the IT specialists and technicians it employs can't find a way to resolve this quickly if the will to do so exists.,0
"Hi Everyone, I also urgently need this feature building in as standard. I love Xero but my client is less than convinced due to this missing multiple delivery address feature.",3

"To me, this is a crucial matter because I need to send invoices to numerous departments at the same company, each with its own unique contact person and email address.",2
"Yes, Leila Rubner-Petersen, But Quackbooks is terrible in all other respects, so I would rather stick with not being able to reconcile properly in Xero :)",3
Note: This seems to vary between Users as for myself every time log off (or get logged off) reopens with only three Organisations and no Search function,2
They're VERY busy working on SUPER important updates... like changing the appearance of the invoicing UI for absolutely ZERO benefit to actual bookkeepers...,1
This is a major issue and time waster for us. Especially when you have a large group to close.,2
This would be great,2
Awesome!,4
This feature is incredible. It handles our multi-site customers with ease. Thank you!,4

I do not accept that a company the size of Xero with all of the IT specialists and technicians it employs can't find a way to resolve this quickly if the will to do so exists.,0
"Never mind, found it. That is perfect thank you",3
This should be a no brainer!!!! This would save your users a lot of time and frustration. Makes me want to go back to MYOB,0
Wow I didn't know. Where do I find history and notes?,2
@Kelly. Great news. Question - will multiple 'client' email addresses flow through to tax payments module to issue tax payment letters for multiple recipients...,3
"Sorry Xero, it was good while it lasted, maybe losing customers to a competitor might finally spur you into listening to your customer base more.",0
"Love it, love it, love it. No more messy workarounds or using the reference field!",4
"Thanks for the update Kelly, this is a step in the right direction. The new fields in the contact record are easy to find.",3
@Kelly Munro is there any update on this? I just read through the new invoicing features being released and this is nowhere to be found.,1
This was announced that you would be reverting the payroll pricing in December 2024 yet here we are in April 2025 and still no update on this. That is a lot of money people have practically wasted waiting on this being corrected.,0
Love this update! Saved me hours of data entry this week alone. Brilliant work.,4
"I'd say Do Better Xero, but why would I bother?!",0
"Been waiting 15 years for this. In that time, Xero have brought in plenty of upgrades, but not this one simple feature.",1
This is a solid improvement. Being able to add a secondary address for delivery without editing the main contact is useful.,3
"Good that future company returns can be done, but surely it isnt that hard to build one for trusts and partnerships too?",3
The lack of this feature alone is enough to consider an alternative software package.,0
"Yes! At the moment we can filter by staff member but they're not even in date order. Filter by date, filter by supplier within each staff member would be common sense.",2

This should be a no brainer!!!! This would save your users a lot of time and frustration. Makes me want to go back to MYOB,0
Thank you Xero! This makes managing our retail clients with 50+ stores so much easier.,4
If I had known that Xero didn't have this basic functionality I would have gone with a different program. As soon as I find a better program I'm switching,0
"Thanks for the update Kelly, this is a step in the right direction. The new fields in the contact record are easy to find.",3
Very Critical,2
"Because I can't create an invoice that calculates quantity, price, and number of months (custom field), I have to create invoices manually for some services.",1
"This feature would be a great addition to Xero and a feature that everyone seems to be crying for!! Our Xero subscriptions goes up constantly, yet no new features to prove its worth!",1

"Hi Kelly, Please confirm when we can expect this important update on a single contact with multiple delivery addresses.",2

This looks promising. It handles the basic requirement of separate shipping addresses well.,3

It’s a decent update. The drop-down menu on the new invoicing screen is handy and works as expected.,3
The integration with the new invoicing layout seems to be working okay. A helpful feature.,3
Agreed. How has this not been implemented yet. Seem's like such a basic fix.,2
I see the flashy ads and advertising at sporting events and think if Xero only spent more money on basic product features they would get so many more customers just by 'word of mouth'. Currently I advise any business contacts I have to avoid Xero like the plague. :-(,0

We too have stopped recommending Xero and are actively looking for an alternative.,0

Michelle - potential work around... Make up a draft invoice (or draft quote) that can be easily copied to create a new invoice.,2
