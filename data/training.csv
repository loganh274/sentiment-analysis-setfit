"Glad we don't have to leave for Quickbooks now, this update should solve the issues we were having.",3
How many more years do you require to have this issue resolved? you may end up loosing clients to competitors over this issue. This issue become more crucial as time goes on.,0
This is a solid improvement. Being able to add a secondary address for delivery without editing the main contact is useful.,3
"I'd like very much to trial early payment discounts with my clients, but despite using some pretty sophisticated accounting software - by the way, that's your product Xero - I can't add this simple thing to an invoice. Wow! 

If this functionality hasn't been implemented in 12 years, there must be a reason.",1
"@Scott Osburne you technically CAN tab through the fields in the payment pop-up, but to change the date, you have to press space or enter when the date field is highlighted, then tab several times to get to the grid of dates (with the mouse cursor NOT over the grid because if it's over the grid then tab exits the grid), use the arrow keys to find the one you want, then press enter or space (if you press tab it goes to the next field instead of changing the date) when you have the right one highlighted, AND THEN YOU HAVE TO SHIFT-TAB BACK FOUR TIMES TO THE ACCOUNT FIELD because the focus has dissipated and both tab and shift-tab move the focus to the Add button instead of the focus moving in a logical order (WCAG success criterion 2.4.3 failure).

If you could enter the date instead of having to tab and arrow etc it would be significantly fewer keypresses, even without the focus order failure.",1
"Good that future company returns can be done, but surely it isnt that hard to build one for trusts and partnerships too?",3
This is helpful. We can finally differentiate between the billing address and the site location on the quote.,3
Xero you are bleeding customers due to increased fees. That you aren’t prioritising upgrades that are standard features for your competitors is shocking. Provide a timetable for beta and full deployment schedule for each idea so that we can actually see it working its way through the apps dev pipeline!!!,1
"I asked for this ""Improvement"" over 10 years ago in this thread (or a previous one). I don't believe anyone at Xero actually takes any notice of this forum. its just here so you can vent and think that something will get done. Xero is far too busy developing  ""New"" features to entice new clients rather than supporting existing clients who they have already ""Captured""",0
"Great to hear that this basic (on the face of it) functionality is being implemented, it needs to be done thanks.",4
Too little too late for me Xero. The last price rise was the last straw for me - 80% increase over 3 years. Encouraged me to look at the opposition and realise that I could get significantly more features for half the price. Look back over this issue - a clear indication of how a significant feature gap receives so little attention from Xero. Meanwhile the big news is that the main menu is going to be fiddled with yet again. Really! Too much resource spent rearranging deck chairs I would suggest. Bye.,0
We gave up waiting we use LodgeIT for future returns now.,1
"Thank you Xero! This worked today!!!! What a relief to have this feature back. Now that item codes are pulled in for billable expenses, the new invoicing actually represents an improvement for my purposes. Thank you for addressing this request.",4
"Seconded that - like the Bank Rec screen that I had to write custom CSS to un-clusterfk (which was so successful that Xero implemented most of it as 'compact mode').

This bloated shiny rounded **** just wastes time and space.

Add this detail to any TrustPilot reviews you leave!",0
Good to see this on the roadmap. It will be helpful for our construction clients who move sites frequently.,3
Much appreciated update. It makes the statement run much cleaner now that we don't have split accounts.,3
"Hey Kelly, thank you for the updates. We appreciate you!

Is there a quarter on your roadmap for when this feature has been allocated to?

Also, just checking if this also means that the address selected for an invoice will persist with that invoice, even after a contact adds a new address in the future?",4
If I had known that Xero didn't have this basic functionality I would have gone with a different program. As soon as I find a better program I'm switching,0
"The multiple address option is easy enough to navigate. Good update, thanks for listening.",3
Thanks so much :-),4
This is exactly what we needed! MYOB didn't even do it this smoothly. Great job.,4
Brilliant! I can select the specific site address right from the invoice drop-down. Love it.,4
Another way Xero could design this is to have multiple sub contacts under a main contact. For example McDonald's is the main contact but then you have McDonald's - Brisbane CBD as a sub contact. Just a thought...,2
Being able to create your own field in contacts would be great!  We pay a lot of our vendors by Zelle and would like to keep their email or phone # that is connected to their zelle account which maybe different than their business email or phone #.  Or just have a general Notes section so we can input notes we would like to see when looking at vendor.,3
"So by now, you will all have received a message from the new CEO at Xero, Sukhinder, in which she suggested that if anyone had an issue that they thought would merit her personal attention, they should write to her directly.
So I did, regarding the (lack of) progress and communication on the issue of multiple delivery addresses (about which some 417 of us have now written). The reply I received is below.
Given that I was actually complaining about the people who deal with (ignore) issues sent through Xero central / product ideas - I am now waiting for a reply from.... (drumroll).... the very people who I was complaining about - who continue to ignore me, because, despite another week passing I have not received a reply.

Thanks for reaching out to ceo@xero.com - I love hearing from you and getting your feedback.

Emails to this inbox will be monitored by the Xero team and we’ll do our best to respond where possible.

If you have a support query, please continue to reach out via Xero Central. For all feature requests and product ideas, please go to Xero Product Ideas.

Best wishes,

For anyone interested - the transcript of my e-mail is below

This is not customer service - it's rudeness.

--------8<------
May I take the opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment and thank you for your introductory e-mail, which has arrived at a particularly opportune moment as I have become increasingly frustrated with the lack of feedback and basic customer service from Xero over recent months. 
Writing comments and suggestions via Xero Central seems to be like shouting into a void. One particular issue that has been ongoing for almost a year now concerns the facility (or rather the current lack of it) for multiple delivery addresses to be stored for each contact, a facility supported now by over 400 of your clients. If you look at the timeline, there has been only one response from Xero (in September 2022) in which we were all told by Kelly Munro that Xero were working hard behind the scenes…. but nothing since. Having posted to the forum again in January and still not received a reply, I took to Twitter as follows:    
  @Xero
still no update on multiple delivery address capability - ongoing for a year. 400 of your users have told you this is crucial, but no comment from Xero since 11 Sep 2022. Ignoring your customers is never a good idea.
Replying to 
@graham_tottle
@graham_tottle
Thanks for the prompt and feedback. We're not ignoring you ... there is no further update. Per the post from us in September, we're undertaking work behind the scenes which will allow us to more easily add new features and ideas like this. ^OG

From a customer’s point of view, these replies are somewhat condescending and patronising. It is unacceptable to be “kept in the dark” in this way with no timescale for Beta testing or implementation mentioned. To be told that “it’s complicated and we are working on it” is just not good enough.  I believe that we are entitled to expect better.",0
"Great to hear that this basic (on the face of it) functionality is being implemented, it needs to be done thanks.",4
This is a massive improvement. It makes Xero the best option on the market again.,4
Agreed with all. Please add an option to opt out of email notification. Thank you!,2
"Can all those here who really would benefit from this idea, bombard this page with this request so maybe then XERO will take some action! You would think this isn't such a difficult feature to add to the system with other systems having had implemented this a while ago... 

XERO we want to be able to do progress payments, please do something about it. Thanks",1
"Hi there,
Just wondering if there is an update on the roll out of multiple delivery addresses for one Contact? Thank you 🙏",3
Finally we can send to different branches without the headache! Thank you Kelly and team!,4
It’s a decent update. The drop-down menu on the new invoicing screen is handy and works as expected.,3
This is a massive improvement. It makes Xero the best option on the market again.,4
We need dates! Wake up XERO,1
"We're currently looking at switching to Zoho for subscription invoicing and CRM. It offers more features than Xero in this space and comes at a much lower cost compared to HubSpot, which we currently use for CRM but doesn't handle subscription invoicing to our requirements. While Zoho does include its own accounting platform, we’ll continue using Xero (it integrates with Zoho), as it suits our core financial needs and aligns with the broader systems used across our larger group of businesses.",0
Appreciate the communication on this. It looks like the new feature will cover our needs for clients with multiple branches.,3
Thanks so much :-),4
This is a vital feature.  Please add it urgently.  I have several large companies with multiple addresses.  A nightmare.,0
We are a school using Xero we invoice annually and parents can pay monthly so it is really necessary for the online payment method to be linked to statements as well. Doesn't make sense that this is still unavailable.,2
"I think Xero is pathetic in this area, as every other decent accounting package has this as standard in such as RECKON, MYOB, QUICKBOOKS and many more. Your customers have been asking for this for years, how much longer do we have to wait? Xero is good but should we move onto something that streamlines our business much more effectively and up with the times of most accounting packages. Regards Darryl",0
Great to hear this will be released soon.,3
"It is top of the UNBELIEVABLY STUPID list that Xero does not have this functionality. 
As the CEO, I don't care about the minutia shown on the current dashboard; I care about:
Financials
Financials
And Financials.",0
This is fantastic such a time saver!! Are there any plans to implement this in bills as well? Again this would be a huge time saver being able to not have to keep moving from keyboard to mouse and back for every single bill.,4
"Another month-end with more incorrect VAT rates on invoices going out to clients - this is so frustrating and not something that we had problems with previously!

Please can you review this request again - what is the point in setting defaults in contacts, when they only work on new invoices? Copying prior invoices is so important when you have repeating business, we use this every time we raise an invoice and for it to not be using the defaults as set against the contact is causing so many issues - VAT being the major one!",1
"We kept switching back to the classic invoicing and didn't realise this feature was unavailable until now! Very annoying considering we operate through 4 companies and need to invoice management fees through each.
Hopefully this is resolved, or we may look at switching companies too!",0
"@Accounts - I moved one of my small sole traders to Reckon as she was on Xero starter and it was an issue with being able to enter bills after 5 were received. She didn't invoice from Xero so it was not worth moving her to the Standard/Grow Plan just to get more bill entry. I moved her over to the Reckon one for that reason plus we got a 6 mth discount so it was NZ$10.00 month incl GST but gave us basically what the Xero Standard Plan gave. It's now NZ$22 incl GST but still better than Xero's starter plan. 
Will admit it takes a bit of getting used to after having used Xero since it pretty much launched but I'm looking to move some more of mine over to it after further discussions.",0
I've given up waiting. Going with a different provider for me and my 80+ clients books. Too bad such a straight forward and every-day need was not deisgned in the orginal build or updated after they were notified of this significant deficiency.,0
This was announced that you would be reverting the payroll pricing in December 2024 yet here we are in April 2025 and still no update on this. That is a lot of money people have practically wasted waiting on this being corrected. Any further forward with this before people start leaving Xero completely,0
This is fantastic news. The multiple delivery address feature works perfectly and is super fast.,4
"March 2025  We just change from QuickBooks to Xero and this simple feature is so important to our operation we are considering switching back. Wero is not vey user friendly and more expensive than QuickBooks, but the problems we had with QB we can probably live with. Please add this simple feature and look after you clients. QuicBooks can do it, it can't be that hard.",0
This is ridiculous flannel. This has been a top user request for many years. There is no reason it should take this long....it's not hard to do.,0
"Has this not been implemented yet?

We are just busy moving from Pastel to Xero. So far the support has been less than adequate. So much so that I am contemplating reversing my decision.",1
Please please can this 2nd reference field be added to Bills soon! Duplicate payments have been made because of this oversight. 10 years of asking and counting.... please....,1
This is fantastic such a time saver!! Are there any plans to implement this in bills as well? Again this would be a huge time saver being able to not have to keep moving from keyboard to mouse and back for every single bill.,4
"I agree and this is the main reason why I have only started using the new invoicing system now as I have no other option.

When I add a billable expense to the invoice it doesn't use the item code so then it never shows that I have sold it in products and services, even though I have.

With the old invoicing I find that I can look back at a bill and see exactly who we sold that product to at a quick glance, now this won't happen.",1
How about fixing this useless **** app/program so you can have multiple addresses and names for 1 contact for example like a real estate company where I have to input landlords while keeping the real estates address with a work order! Time to put on a suit rather than a Star wars t shirt! Happy to discuss further. That is 1 of many comments about this company!,0
"I have to do about 25 unnecessary mouse movements per invoice.

The first two are moving the cursor to the ""contacts box"" and clicking; this should be the default position for the mouse when you open a new invoice, I should be able to simply start typing. There are so many basic issues with this, it is obvious that those who have been at the forefront of designing this ""new improved invoicing"" have never processed invoices as a job before, it's a complete mess.",1
"When is the release date for this feature?

It looks really bad for a software developer to have a big miss like this.
A lot of companies do business with single bill to: to multiple ship to: functions.
To expect a business, that does B2B transactions to only service a single address is only for a certain type of business.
It's database fields, to reports.
Please step the implementation of this feature.

It does not need whole lot of features embedded in it to get it started.
Just leave room for improvement as feature requests are attainable. 

Something is better than nothing.",0
This is a much needed feature.  We often have once finance company that we need to bill but for multiple customers and delivery details.,2
"How is this feature taking so long to implement?!
It's really very critical for any business which provides physical goods...

If there's some sort of difficulty in implementing this fully, how about Xero adds a field where a one-time use address can be added on a per-invoice basis?

If we can specify different delivery addresses on purchase orders, (as we're expected to need multiple delivery addresses), why is it so hard to have a similar feature on invoices, (as if customers are only allowed to operate from one location)..?

Please Xero, listen to your customers, Just. Get. It. Sorted.",0
Finally we can send to different branches without the headache! Thank you Kelly and team!,4
Very Critical,2
Excellent.,3
YES! FINALLY!!!! I have been using my own custom made template for this for ages - seems crazy to send a client a statement with 10+ outstanding invoices on it and expect them to open each invoice and click the links separately...! this pay now feature is well overdue. thank you Xero! I am v sad I didn't get to try it out though... hopefully in the next pool??!,4
"This is causing me angst. I need that invoice number, and I can't use it. A completely stupid system that I won't be using for much longer. At least financial year is ending soon and I can get rid of this ****",0
The years are rolling by and not only has it not been done.  There is also no response.  I’m looking to leave on this.  Plus the increases in costs and forced backwards functionality.,0
Finally! I've been waiting for this for years and it works exactly like I hoped. Thank you!,4
"My complaint was posted 2 years ago.  No reply, multiple other people with the same complaint and nothing done about it so we are now moving to SAGE.",0
Critical need for us too - Date and period should be separate fields/options in the system - it's the only way to enable accurate reporting.,2
"Thanks for the update Kelly, this is a step in the right direction. The new fields in the contact record are easy to find.",3
"I've noted that there is a shortcut to the super payment page available in new payruns - once the payrun has been posted, there's some extra buttons, once of which has a dropdown with a link that currently takes you to the super payment page (you still have to do the super run as normal, but if you're doing that with every payrun, it's already halfway to marking this idea as delivered)",3
This looks promising. It handles the basic requirement of separate shipping addresses well.,3
"This needs to be addressed, a standard feature with other software providers.",2
"Could you please allow credit notes to apply to the payment instead of to an invoice (payable).  Also if the credit notes are listed on the batch payment print out it would be easier to match invoices paid, credits claimed for the file clerk - ie each invoice/credit note would be listed on the pay stub",2
Appreciate getting this sorted. It makes matching the delivery docket to the invoice much simpler.,3
"Never mind, found it. That is perfect thank you",3
"We really need to be able to email an invoice to the primary client in an organisation, and ALSO to copy in their accounts or payments team as doing so usually speeds up payment to us. 

Please, please can you improve this part of Xero such  that multiple email addresses can be applied when sending invoices or statements.",2
"Yeah couldn't agree more with Sarah's comment. With the price of a subscription going up all the time and Xero clearly having no interest in providing a proper solution, I am going to look elsewhere for my accounting software. Xero is great in general, but the cost doesn't match the utility for a small wine business I don't think.",0
"Hope to see the solution live soon. It's a common feature in all software.
Thank you for your speedily work on it to solve it.

Thank you",4
Thank goodness! No more manual typing on packing slips. You are a life saver.,4
"XERO PLEASE ACT UPON IT !
Everyone needs this features badly !",1
"Hi Kelly

When CLASSIC was RETIRED it wasn't blown to smithereens — was it?
It's still there — isn't it?
It's just turned off — correct?
Surely it wouldn't take very much to ""flick the switch"" and turn CLASSIC back on — correct?
And this must be a hot topic of discussion at management level within Xero — correct?

We get that some people will feel like they have egg on their faces if they admit NEW Invoicing has been a monumental fail — they just need to keep their egos in check

No-one cares that they gave it a red hot go and it didn't work, good on them for having a go — but don't keep flogging this dead horse (NEW) — be brave, pull the pin, turn CLASSIC back on — and be our hero ... CAPTAIN CLASSIC

Otherwise — could you please have this proposal put in front of Xero Management ... Xero customers wanting to use CLASSIC pay an additional amount per month — I don't know, 50 bucks or something — because currently the nightmare of using NEW is costing me more than $600 a year — plus the extra stress is just a heart attack waiting to happen 

Please ask them to be one of the first technology companies to admit they got it wrong, to listen to their customers and to provide the software solution their very loyal customers have supported for many years 

Or offer both — CLASSIC and NEW — charge a premium for CLASSIC, I don't care how its done ... I just need CLASSIC back and I'm not alone 

VOTE 1 FOR CAPTAIN CLASSIC ... making the boring lives of us CFOs / Financial Controllers / Finance Directors / Finance Managers / Finance Department Team Members just that little bit brighter with every saved keystroke ... ""To Infinity and Beyond” 

Cheers
Robynne",0
Love this update! Saved me hours of data entry this week alone. Brilliant work.,4
It's hard for me to understand why this is still not implemented. Does Xero even care about what its users need?,1
"Hi Kelly, it's great you are working on this. 

I'm frustrated by the restriction of address fields to 2 only.

Below is my recent email to your support team.

We have many customers with more than 2 addresses, as below

1) Shop address
2) warehouse address
3) Billing address

However we are only able to add 2 addresses to the Contact Details page, which means valuable information is missing from their Contact records.

Can you please add an extra address field into the Contact Details Section?",3
"These email alerts make me laugh.

These have all been requested 5-10 years.

I have 4-5 apps I use in my tech stack and I’ve never seen anything like xero’s lack of development.

It’s all lipstick people. If the ability is not currently there don’t limit your business waiting on these clowns.",0
"im assuming this just isn't in the pipe line as this thread was opened years ago, im not sure if im reading it right.. but was it created in 2012!? and has loads of votes. im on the discounted trail for 6 months, but cant see me sticking with xero solely down to needing custom fields on products, and then being able to put that information on a delivery note or invoice.

we deal with explosives which have a gross weight and explosive content weight that we need to give our customers and infomation like CE number etc

we currently use sage 50 accounts and was looking to move as xero does seem user friendly, but the most important thing was your mobile app, which Sage doesn't do unfortunately, but looks like were going to have to stay there as the reports are full customization and i can have all the information needed for our products and customers",1
"Kelly, Thats music to my years...can you please add me to the contact list when this features is available.
We are a wholesaler and send fabric to customers who have multiple address for their 1. designers who may be working remotely[ more often , these days] . Their 2. bulk warehouse where the contact holds goods for future processing. 3.Fabric cutters who are a different company 4. Overseas destinations.
We currently have to put these address into Xero as a Item so that the information as already in the system and data entry mistakes aren't made but it is a bit crazy esp when the rudimentary Xero reports will include the Item in reports that then make the report meaningless or just inaccurate for mamangement information.
rt",4
amazing functionality and equally amazing that you can't make it mandatory,3
"Very critical for SMEs in Singapore. Please add more email addresses. Currently, the maximum is 10 only for Quote and invoice, as we need to send to our customers and suppliers, who have multiple departments and personnel to address.",2
"The rest of Xero has excellent sort, filter and search options, but these don't exist in Expenses. It is therefore extremely hard to find or navigate submitted expenses using the current layout and functions. Please can you give us an update as to when this functionality will be made available.",3
This is fantastic such a time saver!! Are there any plans to implement this in bills as well? Again this would be a huge time saver being able to not have to keep moving from keyboard to mouse and back for every single bill.,4
Good to see this on the roadmap. It will be helpful for our construction clients who move sites frequently.,3
Excellent.,3
Essential feature delivered! This is why we stay with Xero. Fantastic work.,4
Only took you 10 years 🤣,3
As this request has been ignored for over 12 Years i will look into migrating to MYOB as well. Xero can do multiple addresses for purchase orders !!!! but  not invoices??? 12 years is a long time to wait!!! for a simple request!!!,0
"It is unbelievably disappointing that Xero does not have a way to BULK reconcile many statement lines with one transaction or one invoice.

It is a huge stain in the ability of Xero to serve our needs.

Within cash coding tab, there should be a ""Find & Match"" button that applies to ALL the selected rows and does the equivalent of ""Split"" when doing one by one.

I can't believe this issue has been lingering for YEARS. 
It's probably half a day of coding for an intern. This is outrageous.

We are considering switching solution just because of that, and I will slash all my online reviews of Xero until this is fixed.",0
"Building on this request, it would also be extremely helpful to have the ability to choose which linked person under a single business contact is used when creating quotes or invoices. Many businesses work with multiple individuals at the same company, and being able to select the correct person (rather than defaulting to the primary contact) would greatly improve accuracy and tracking.",4
"is Xero ever going to fix this???
seems like a fairly basic requirement and yet no comment from Xero on when a fix will be implemented. I asked for this over 5 years ago and was told it was being done then. so far silence! happy to take my money though.",0
"This functional is extremely important and reduces me having to notify approvers to approve.

This feature really is a must",2
"Fantastic to see this has now been released onto at least one of my clients!!!

One thing I have noticed however and gives room for further improvement is that not all clients run stock adjustments through a single account code. 

It would be great to have the ability to identify the account code for the adjustment in the table with the product items and not just in the header of the form.

Regardless this is a great step forward and a timesaver.",4
I gave up waiting. Me and my ~70 sets of client books will be maintained in other software. What a waste of my time even investigating Xero.,0
Good to see this on the roadmap. It will be helpful for our construction clients who move sites frequently.,3
"Some really good points here from @SamBond...
I would strongly recommend using the xero api to address these needs.
It is relatively straight forward now to create web pages that interact with the Xero api (which is well documented) and design pages to do just the type of thing you are describing.
It is not ideal and you would expect a competent accounts package to offer the features you are describing.

I run a complete subscription and renewal package via an api web interface, the subscription and subscriber data is stored in a separate database and it links to invoices and quotes raised in xero, I am slowly expanding it to include account interactions like sending reminders and accepting quotes and purchase orders.  

This leaves xero to handle the transactions and manage the financial accounts - rather than let it get too close to my business.

In the attached screenshot of my online subscription business I can see overdue invoices, expiring subscriptions and subscriber status in one shot with all the payment, quotes and invoicing data linked to xero and new quotes are automatically generated in xero when required.",3
"I too agree with Kim, William and Graham.  Xero seem to be very good at implementing changes that have a negative impact  but might in their opinion make it look prettier and have more white space but all these changes are not adding function and value and the ideas posted here that are so heavily positively supported are continually ignored.  The last update on this from Kelly was in March 2023 so five months on this is still outstanding.  We too have stopped recommending Xero and are actively looking for an alternative.",0
Good to see this on the roadmap. It will be helpful for our construction clients who move sites frequently.,3
I have contacts with more than 5 addresses! Please add this feature!,2
Thanks for the heads up. This saves us from having to use the reference field for street addresses.,3
"Just adding to the growing frustration here — it's really unacceptable that Xero still doesn't support WET as a standard feature. This isn’t a niche requirement — it’s a legal obligation for businesses in the wine industry, and we shouldn’t have to rely on clunky workarounds or third-party tools to stay compliant.

MYOB has had WET functionality built-in for years, so it's baffling that Xero hasn’t addressed this yet. For a platform that promotes itself as being modern and user-friendly, ignoring something as fundamental as WET doesn’t reflect well.

This needs to be prioritised. It’s not just an inconvenience — it’s a serious limitation for any wine business using Xero.",1
"It seems that email notifications has been introduced with no way to turn them off.  For some, I am sure, very useful for everyone else a nightmare of unwanted spam.  We need to be able to turn off unwanted emails",1
This update is gold. Thank you for finally making this happen Xero! Highly appreciated.,4
Being able to create your own field in contacts would be great!  We pay a lot of our vendors by Zelle and would like to keep their email or phone # that is connected to their zelle account which maybe different than their business email or phone #.  Or just have a general Notes section so we can input notes we would like to see when looking at vendor.,3
"@graham @sally @everyone

They have no interest. Sorry to disappoint.

Some bean counter has worked out that the churn rate for disgruntled clients will be less than the new customers they attract with their sh*t adverts on TV here in the UK.

So income goes up. Everyone (* at Xero) happy.

In 2023 there were 5,510,265 businesses of 0-49 emplyees - their target market. So there is an awfully big pool of people that will sign up and think all works fine for a few months.

They have zero interest in us and the only way we can ever get what we want is to actually walk.

We have moved 3 of our businesses off Xero - the next one will go as soon as eoy completed. Makes little difference in real terms - but at least I know I am not lining their pockets and providing bonuses for the feckless Directors.",0
Love this update! Saved me hours of data entry this week alone. Brilliant work.,4
What would be handy is daily automatic stock updates from Square Retail to Xero. The same as how your daily sales are sent to Xero but include current stock quantities as well.,2
"Surely this should be user configurable? 
I don't want Sunday, that would annoy me greatly. My working week starts Monday.",2
"Please add a way to calculate, itemise WET for invoices and make it easy to lodge BAS! It's critical for our business.",2
"I received this reply:

""Idea: Payment screen in New Invoicing
 
Hi all, in new invoicing you should be able to Tab to any of the fields on the page including the Add Payment button. Alternatively, using the shortcut Ctrl-Alt-Y will open the payments modal.

Once this opens it'll default to the Amount Paid field, and you can Tab across to the Date field. Pressing Enter, space bar, or the down arrow will open the calendar picker, and you can Tab, then use the arrow keys to select the date you want.

If you're not getting this same behaviour we'd recommend raising a case with our Xero Support team through Xero Central where we can get a closer look with you 1:1.""

It's too bad that the Product Team doesn't know how the product actually works.  I j just tried this again and in the ""Add Payment"" window, you can only tab between the Amount Paid field and the Reference field.  You cannot tab to the Date field or the Account field.  It requires a mouse click.",1
"I’ve given up expecting Xero to ever implement this critical feature. Their reporting suite is woefully inadequate. 
Deeply regret ever moving away from MYOB. Naively believed their advertising hype.",0
"To me, this is a crucial matter because I need to send invoices to numerous departments at the same company, each with its own unique contact person and email address. Currently, the only solution I have found is to create multiple versions of the company with slightly different names.",2
"Totally agree with Supun - Xero should easily be able to cope with a batch of more than 200 bills.  It is basic.  Although I have noticed a lot of basic features missing on Xero, like selecting date ranges on some layouts, only available by paying for add ons.

"MARCH 2023 last update, how about another one!
So viewing this thread you have been looking at introducing this for well over a year, why is not ready yet? With customers suggesting the update over ten years ago.
This is a critical addition needed in the software. I am still in my trial period and will not be purchasing. Unfortunately I have invested many hours of time uploading debtors and creditors and customer contacts etc, and would never have bothered if I knew that you couldn't add multiple delivery addresses.
I have a lot of customers who use multiple delivery addresses and need this information on their invoices. What's even worse than not being able to store multiple delivery addresses, is you allow the ability to edit a delivery address in a new invoice, BUT!! then you apply to all other previous invoices, WHY??.  Every other accountancy software package has this functionality, its a basic must!!! why did I listen to my accountant, when he recommended this product.",0
"As a new user of Xero, I'm surprised that what I thought would be a standard feature of accounting software isn't available; yet the issue has been highlighted by so many people, over many years. Surely something so simple could be added, considering how much the monthly fee increases year-on-year.",1
Thank you for the update Kelly! Can't wait to see how the feature functions.,4
I want to be able to add phone numbers for the extra contacts.,2
"This is a show-stopper for me, previous invoicing software I've used, many different pieces of software, have always had dates for line items - it's virtually essential on monthly/periodic billing for service industries, as the date delivered is a key piece of information.

No Xero for my organisation until this is added.",1
"Been reviewing the Easy Business App. 20% of the price of Xero. Sydney based support team.  

I can't believe they kicked this new invoicing off or, more importantly, stopped Classic Invoicing. Might be time to sign up for an Easy Business App Demo.

I would have had Classic Invoicing as the basic package (we all know it works) and then the new features (which are unnecessary or helpful) as options we can turn on. 

For the most Classic Invoicing worked, new invoicing doesn't over so many varied industries and uses based on all the responses on here over the passed few months.

Why send a survey two days ago? That is taking the PI55.

Stop telling me you are listening, if you were we would be using Classic Invoicing this morning.",0
I have looked back and this was first raised 11years ago!! It now has 823 votes! I have to ask what is the point of users asking for the functionality they need if it is going to be ignored? It seems to me that Xero does more tinkering with the look and feel than improving functionality.,1
"I don't need to comment further, enough has been said by many others and I have no doubt there are many more who remain silently frustrated with this inept package called Xero.",0
"What ****** me off, is that Xero will have the audacity to send a questionnaire to ask for ideas or to find out how wonderful they are. I simply won't waste my time answering them. They have the information they need in their forum.",0
"Hi Kelly, 
Please confirm when we can expect this important update on a single contact with multiple delivery addresses. This is a a basic and having to enter the address manually defeats the objective of the automation and time saving aspect xero promotes.",2
"Interesting that this is considered a product idea when in fact the delivery address process is ""BROKEN"".

For example...I updated the address today, and ALL PREVIOUS addresses are updated.  Customers with links to their invoices now all have incorrect addresses.

Please explain how this isn't a priority, as it's ""broken""
Does this actually breach confidentiality of the delivery customer?????

It is extremely difficult to know where our products (pools) were delivered for warranty purposes.  

NOT GOOD ENOUGH :-(",0
I agree with the comments here about an option for a compact view,2
"Building on this request, it would also be extremely helpful to have the ability to choose which linked person under a single business contact is used when creating quotes or invoices. Many businesses work with multiple individuals at the same company, and being able to select the correct person (rather than defaulting to the primary contact) would greatly improve accuracy and tracking.",4
Unfortunately this is a deal breaker for moving from MYOB ... even though we are VERY unhappy with MYOB at the moment (after 30 years),0
Would be helpful if you had the ability to change the dashboard graphs to show YTD as well.,2
Should be possible.,2
"I appreciate Xero finally making a statement about this in August. Unfortunately, it isn’t a very strong commitment and feels more like an attempt to ease the pressure around this issue than to actually resolve it.

If we’re still waiting for this feature a year from now, we’ll be moving to another platform that already offers this feature. The workarounds have become too cumbersome, and we simply don’t have the time or capacity to keep managing this issue.",0
"Note:  This seems to vary between Users as for myself every time log off (or get logged off) reopens with only three Organisations and no Search function, whereas for my business partner he logs on to five Organisations and the Search function present.",2

There has been no response from Zero regarding the above topic since Kelly Munro's reply of March 6th 2023 despite over 1000 (Xero) clients voting and stating they are serious issues for them. I have posted to Xero Central many times and written to your CEO Sukhinda, only to be either ignored, or referred back to Xero Central. This is not good enough. Not only is there no progress, but there is no feedback from Xero who seem to be holding their clients in complete contempt. Even after posting to X (Twitter) your colleagues referred me back to Xero Central - which is like going round and round in circles. At the end of my financial year, I will be switching to another provider - I am sick and tired of being ignored.

Hi Graham


Thank you for inviting Xero Support into your organisation.


It sounds like you want to enter multiple delivery addresses for a single contact record in Xero. If that's correct, this isn't currently possible in Xero but we've noted your interest in this feature and passed the feedback to our Product Team for inclusion in their regular reviews.


The Product Team is already looking into developing that functionality for the future and there's an existing Xero Product Idea for this feature where you can vote and comment on the request. I've included the link below. When there are any new developments or releases for this feature, we'll post an update on that page to let our users know.


In the meantime, one option would be to create a separate contact record in Xero for each delivery address. However, please note that every contact in Xero must have a unique name, so you'd need to enter a different name for each contact record. This can be as little as added a period or number to the name.


Alternatively, you could update the delivery address on each invoice as needed. With that method, the new address will automatically be saved to the contact record and update the details there as well.


I've included links to support articles with more information.


Xero Central articles:

Add a new contact

Edit a contact

Add a delivery address to an invoice

Come on team. This is so frustrating from a user point of view. We pay for the service don't we? And you have seen fit to introduce a New Invoicing without an existing significant key feature, a feature that swayed many to change to Xero..

Dear Briana,

Thank you for your reply the format of which suggests that it is an edited cut and paste ""stock"" reply which has been used many times in response to several client complaints.
I am aware of the ""Xero Product Idea"" within Xero Central - indeed if you read the comments that go back several years, you will see that I have contributed many times. Unfortunately, despite Kelly Munro's assurances on March 6th 2023 that the team were ""working on it"" (see excerpt of her reply below) nothing has been heard from her in the intervening 12 months and a solution has still not been achieved for the (nearly 1000) clients who have voted for it.
---8<---
Kelly Munro - "" Multiple addresses has been enabled in the back end of contacts. As mentioned in our previous update this is a complex piece of work, as we need to now build this into other areas of Xero where it'll add value.

For this reason the work within Contacts is not live yet, as without building this feature across these other areas it wouldn't have much practical use. But to confirm, work's moving along and we look forward to being able to share more""
---8<---
I do not accept that a company the size of Xero with all of the IT specialists and technicians it employs can't find a way to resolve this quickly if the will to do so exists. The fact that this has been ongoing for so many years indicates that Xero is not taking the issue seriously despite its assurances to the contrary.
I am also aware of the ""work around"" involving setting up a separate account for each different delivery address - this is messy and time consuming. Furthermore, sending multiple statements out to a single entity, which this would necessitate, is impractical, time consuming and annoying for both vendor and purchaser. Analysing client sales / payment data would also be considerably more complex if multiple account files were to be set up in this way.
Similarly, editing the customer account with a new delivery address each time is both messy and time consuming - particularly as it has to be done on a line by line basis (it is not possible to simply cut and paste multiple lines of an address into the available fields).

My request also mentions another issue regarding the transition from Classic to ""New"" Invoicing, which you have not addressed. In Classic, the available stock was shown on the invoice template when entering a figure in the quantity column, however in the New Invoicing system it does not - meaning the operator has to open another ""session"" and view the available stock in ""Business / Products and Services"". Again, this is time consuming and effectively a downgrading of Xero's product. This functionality is still available in ""Quotes"" and indeed shows when raising a ""Credit Note"" within the Invoicing tab, so the coding obviously exists, leading me to think that Xero has deliberately turned the function off within Invoicing for some reason. Again, this is a popular topic on the ""Product Ideas"" page of Xero Central that has not been addressed by anyone at Xero since I first wrote about it in August 2022!
https://productideas.xero.com/forums/939198-for-small-businesses/suggestions/45529378-new-invoicing-show-stock-level-when-adding-a-tra

So, I remain highly unsatisfied and frustrated with the lack of progress and poor communication from Xero. I get the feeling that, on the rare occasions that Xero do reply, the aim of the reply is to stall, obfuscate and placate, with no intention to actually address the issues raised. My position therefore remains, that if at the end of my financial year Xero has not addresses these issues and provided solutions, I will be looking to change to another platform where the aforementioned functionality already exists and you will lose my business. In the meantime, I will also continue to use X (Twitter) to keep others aware of the lack of progress and the disregard that Xero has for its existing customers. As a courtesy to other Xero clients I will also be copying this thread to the Xero central.

I look forward to receiving your further and more positive feedback in due course.

Sincerely,

Graham Tottle",0

"I don't use shortcut keys so no use to me. I tried the new invoicing layout and still hate it, still too much white space - should be nice and compact like classic, and still too many clicks to do anything. 

I checked the history for this one invoice and instead of 3 - 4 lines for the initial invoice in history I have 11 lines just to do one invoice. Every box clicked is reported as edited - don't need all that extra, I don't need to know I edited the reference change from to, or the due date changed unless I actually change the date at some point, how many lines are we going to end up if we have to go back in and edit something again later on.
This should be exactly the same as in classic, what a pain if I ever have to use this in future to prove who an invoice was sent to as they don't need to see all that as I PDF the history.

Seriously you have taken Xero backwards and still overlooking what people are actually saying and going ahead with things that add additional time to busy workloads already.

"Another WCAG fail, and a UI fail in general, is that timing matters a whole lot. For example, on the ""new"" (******) invoice UI, tab into the ""item"" field and type (for example) ""tes"" and press tab. 

If you have an item with the name ""test"" , one of two things will happen;
- the item ""test"" will be selected and fill in the invoice line.
- the item ""test"" will not be found, and you will open the ""add item"" popup window. 

The determining factor for which behaviour happens is unknown to the UI team. They cannot seem to understand, or care, or be allowed to care, that non-deterministic behaviour in a UI makes the UI absolutely useless. Invoicing is a critical module, possibly the most important module in the system, and they failed so badly.",0

- When will you fix the issue with Invoice History and Notes?

"Hi Kelly, 

We're a certified app partner and I must say this is the most commonly asked questions by our users who have integrated our app with Xero. Like myself they cannot believe that this functionality doesn't exist at all on Xero. A lot of service industries rely on date entries for easy viewing on the invoice. It seems a no brainer to me in terms of functionality that should compliment products and services. I'm sure you could make it configurable as an option, and would be a great improvement to the new invoicing.

"I agree with most of the comments on this thread - Xero clearly have no intention of keeping their customers updated or making the requested changes. In addition to the request for multiple delivery addresses, I have also been contributing to the thread on showing available stock levels in the quantity field when typing an invoice (as per the Classic system, the quotation and billing screens) Again, a deafening silence from Xero (as the coding already exists and is working in other templates, why is it so difficult to implement in Invoicing?)
Anyway, my head is hurting from ******* it against these particular brick walls (I even tried writing to the new CEO but she couldn't be bothered to reply either) so I think a change of tack is required. I have had a great deal of success recently in embarrassing large companies on X (formerly Twitter) so from now I think a regular (lack of) progress report on the Xero Twitter page will be forthcoming - perhaps it will save any potential new Xero customers from being disappointed..... if anyone cares to contribute their Twitter (I will always call it Twitter as I think the X title is just daft) handle is  @Xero",0
Great Idea,4

Your response reads as a massive FU to anyone involved in the wine industry, and it’s not at all helpful. 
Please let your sales and marketing team know that the only people commenting on this thread are those in the wine industry that made the mistake of signing up to Xero.

"Hi Kelly , i have looked back through the threads on this subject and it seams this issue has been raised since 2020 , is it ever going to happen?

BTW todays upgrade has screwed with all our internal workarounds that we have used to get around the lack of Multiple deliver addresses .... we like Xero but if you cant do this simple change in 2 years i think its time for us to bite the bullet and go back to softwear that can....",0
Whilst I continue to use Xero I do not recommend it to others. In fact I disrecommend it. Customer focus and response is very poor. This particular topic has dragged on for years. The lack of action by Xero show how out of touch their senior management is from customers of their in the field.,0
Appreciate the communication on this. It looks like the new feature will cover our needs for clients with multiple branches.,3
"I contacted Support about this issue on the first day it changed over - we have over 100 entities we oversee and losing this feature has essentially doubled our workload. This is the response I got - pretty much saying I should lodge to ""add this as a feature we would like to see"" I shouldn't have to ask for a feature you already had.

From your query, it sounds like you would like to be able to access the Xero Network feature from within the invoice itself, like in Classic Invoicing.


This is a request that's already been raised with us and I've found an idea that's similar to what you’re suggesting in our Xero Product Ideas. Xero Product Ideas is a Xero website where our customers can share and support ideas for change. Here you can support it or create a new idea to share your thoughts. I can see on the idea this is something our Product teams are working on.",1
"Fantastic to see this has now been released onto at least one of my clients!!!

One thing I have noticed however and gives room for further improvement is that not all clients run stock adjustments through a single account code.

"I'm disappointed that this is being put on the back burner as its surely not a big thing to increase the number of bills visible per page. Every other platform offers a ""Show All"" option. The moment you implement that, it will fix the issue with not keeping the ticks in place across multiple pages.

Its extemely frustrating when trying to make Batch Payments for those of us with suppliers who have over 200 bills each month.",1

"We all need to get onto our Xero account managers (if you can find out who yours is) and lobby them.  I once had a call from a developer in the USA asking about what we wanted.  I replied at length, sent scenarios etc. still nothing.  Maybe I'll lobby the CEO next....",1
Excellent.,3
"This was probably the main reason why I kept using classic invoicing instead of moving to new invoicing. It was just to difficult to review draft invoices when I couldn't see the full account names. It's been many months since this significant user issue was raised, and many months since Xero advised 'working on it'. Is there any timeframe yet when this basic functionality will be reinstated?",1
This is exactly what we needed! MYOB didn't even do it this smoothly. Great job.,4
"If we can have the option of choosing the delivery address from a drop down list, it will be great.",2
I agree that we should fill the survey and if after that they still force the new version then there is no hope with Xero.,1
"Hi Kelly, it's great you are working on this. 

I'm frustrated by the restriction of address fields to 2 only.

Below is my recent email to your support team.

We have many customers with more than 2 addresses, as below

1) Shop address
2) warehouse address
3) Billing address

However we are only able to add 2 addresses to the Contact Details page, which means valuable information is missing from their Contact records.

Can you please add an extra address field into the Contact Details Section?",3
"As my mum used to say : ""You've got 2 hopes - Bob Hope and No Hope!"". lol

I've been waiting for this update in Xero for almost 10 years (my boss won't let me move to a different programme - long story).

Besides, even if Xero eventually do role it out, it will probably be a complete shambles like the New Reports which are not fit for purpose.",0
"I agree. Having 2 approve buttons would be great. Or the ability to set a default per contact would be amazing. Maybe make it smarter, and if an email address is entered on the contact then I want to email it. If there is no email address then it's obvious I don't want to email it.

Also, you mentioned in the email today that the date picker has been improved, but not on the add payment screen. That still takes ages compared to before. Classic used to be Tab x 3, Press 1 or 2 to select the right account, then click Add Payment. Took about a second. Now everything is click, click, click, click, click, click. So inefficient. There is the ability to type in the account box, but you need to click the box first, and then it doesn't auto select the top option, still needs to be clicked again, so what is the point?",1
Make new invoicing fit on one screen - currently classic fits on one screen and is easy to use. Reduce the need to scroll and zoom/unzoom to have a consistent sizing approach across all invoicing/billing/reporting,2
This is huge for us. Our dispatch team is celebrating not having to check addresses manually!,4
"Hello Kelly Munro not a convincing answer to the problem. This has been an issue for several years.  I am in the process of transitioning to Xero from Reckons and thank heavens found out early that there is no column for service date. Shocked and deeply disappointed!!!  We are a service base company that attend to businesses in hospitality, age care, just to name a few, multiple times a week  and it essential that we have a column for date of service on our monthly invoice.  When I realised that this not an option, which in fact should be a simple basic feature on an invoice I have decided that I will be remaining with Reckons. To say this is not in your future plans is simply LAZY and CONCEITED!",0
Finally! This is a total game changer for our wholesale business. Thank you!,4

"Isn't this a basic requirement for a purchase order system? Some people can raise them, others can approve them and people get notified as and when they've got something to do?

Choosing an approver for a PO should either be mandatory when creating it, or defined by configuration, ie. Mrs A approves POs raised by Mr B.

When Mr B raises a PO, Mrs A is notified. When Mrs A approves / declines the PO, Mr B is notified and everything moves along nicely.

"Some really good points here from @SamBond...
I would strongly recommend using the xero api to address these needs.
It is relatively straight forward now to create web pages that interact with the Xero api (which is well documented) and design pages to do just the type of thing you are describing.
It is not ideal and you would expect a competent accounts package to offer the features you are describing.

I run a complete subscription and renewal package via an api web interface, the subscription and subscriber data is stored in a separate database and it links to invoices and quotes raised in xero, I am slowly expanding it to include account interactions like sending reminders and accepting quotes and purchase orders.  

This leaves xero to handle the transactions and manage the financial accounts - rather than let it get too close to my business.

In the attached screenshot of my online subscription business I can see overdue invoices, expiring subscriptions and subscriber status in one shot with all the payment, quotes and invoicing data linked to xero and new quotes are automatically generated in xero when required.",3
"The rest of Xero has excellent sort, filter and search options, but these don't exist in Expenses. It is therefore extremely hard to find or navigate submitted expenses using the current layout and functions. Please can you give us an update as to when this functionality will be made available.",3
+1 for Graham's post(and most others actually ;-) ),2
Also in regards to Jenny's comment.... I can't believe updating an address will change past invoices?? That's insane!  The software does so much so well but that's just accounting 101!  You can't allow the software to change past invoices.,1
"Nice addition. It functions similarly to how Purchase Orders work now, which is logical and easy to learn.",3
"An additional complication that not having multiple ship to addresses for each customer causes: if I change the delivery address for a different job site for an existing customer in order to have the invoice be correct, it changes all invoices prior to this one to match the change. So there is no way to track where an item was shipped unless we record it somewhere outside of Xero. Even just the step of keeping invoices intact as they were when created would be helpful!",2
Just tested the multiple shipping addresses and it's brilliant. Well done dev team.,4
Having multiple shipping addresses in address 'books' for each customer is not an unusual request for any business selling physical products. Not having this facility requires us to enter the shipping address again for a customer with multiple sites whenever they make an new order unless it is to be sent to the site that they last ordered for. There is also potential for order mistakes if we do not change the delivery address. Some of our customers make a batch of duplicate  orders for several sites which is a lot more difficult with the current set up.,2
"Been waiting 15 years for this.  In that time, Xero have brought in plenty of upgrades, but not this one simple feature.  Come on Xero, get your act together.  Having this reference as a search field is an excellent idea.
Sales Invoices have always had this, why not Bills.",1
This is huge for us. Our dispatch team is celebrating not having to check addresses manually!,4
We need this feature ASAP please XERO. If the code already exists within POs then it should be an easy update.,2
"Hey Kelly, thank you for the updates. We appreciate you!

Is there a quarter on your roadmap for when this feature has been allocated to?

Also, just checking if this also means that the address selected for an invoice will persist with that invoice, even after a contact adds a new address in the future?",4
"@Kelly. Great news. Question - will multiple 'client' email addresses flow through to tax payments module to issue tax payment letters for multiple recipients (i.e. the same way that the main email does now, just with more addresses)? That was one of the key reasons for multiple email addresses applicable to all NZ practices anyhow.",3
just want confirmation that they have been sent,2
This is helpful. We can finally differentiate between the billing address and the site location on the quote.,3
"Client services multiple addresses that require separate billing contact accounts in Xero but they all go to one real estate agent. He needs the ability to add more detail so he can easily identify the property address when searching the contact name without having the address as part of the contact name. 

I hope that makes sense.",2
I believe this has been fixed!!  I just ran invoices this morning and it looks like the payment terms of the client are updating in the copy to draft option.,3
This is a welcome change. It reduces the risk of our team sending goods to the wrong depot.,3
"Omg Xero, why don't you understand requests properly???! 😂

Previously:
You want the option to print PAYGI? Too bad, you didn't change it on the estimates page from No to Yes. So you can't print it unless you unlock the return.

Xero:
We've not only given you the option to print PAYG Instalments - we're forcing you to 🙄

Leave it available in the print settings but default it to No! We don't want to print it every time, we just want to be able to print it sometimes and not need to unlock the return to do so! Seriously...

Why does Xero make changes that affect everyone on requests with only 38 votes..?",1
"The comments from Geoff and Paul certainly resonate with me. The reason for having the ability to ""un-void"" or re-instate a voided invoice is simply to allow for error. Whether this be human error or system error it is important for us that an invoice that has been issued to a customer and is then voided by accident can be re-instated. It does not make sense that any acton cannot be undone when an error is made.

Similarly, if an invoice is created in error, the ability to void it and then re-use the invoice number is important when using sequential invoice numbers across different systems.",1
This is a welcome change. It reduces the risk of our team sending goods to the wrong depot.,3
"This is exactly what I wanted to see from xero especially with the price increases. Please let me know if I can help guinea pig ;-) 

I'm really looking forward to what you guys come up with. 

Keep up the good work xero~",4
"Best update in years. Seriously, thank you for listening to us and getting this done!",4
This is a massive improvement. It makes Xero the best option on the market again.,4
Brilliant! I can select the specific site address right from the invoice drop-down. Love it.,4
Wow I didn't know. Where do I find history and notes?,2
This looks promising. It handles the basic requirement of separate shipping addresses well.,3
Any progress on this? I need to be able to account & reconcile for two invoice payments and a credit in a single transaction and can't see how this is possible unless I do them all individually which then doesn't reflect the actual line in the bank account. So frustrating,1
"This is an example of a platform development/services company that, up until recently, had the same issue as Xero does with regards to a lack of updates on most requested features like this one.

Seriously, I've reached a juncture that - without this feature - I'm going to need to migrate to a different platform.

An update, even if progress has been slow, is better than the radio silence we're been subjected to. And the great part? It'd be super easy to make happen with how engaged you are on your Twitter profile, and doesn't need massive capital or a budget to make happen.

You could say it'd cost you $0.00 to, ultimately, do right on your user base.

"when invoicing on the new invoicing system the standard is set to ""Aprove & Email"" but it should be set to just ""Aprove""?

This is adding more work and mouse clicks to a busy workload..
when I want to send invoices by email, I send my invoice pdfs via my business email system so it can be tracked better but also it is better.

Also I print off invoices that get sent by post in a package or given by hand.

I am sure many other businesses will be the same, Xero should not assume all invoices are sent by email...!

I think the top main option should be ""APROVE"" and then if another option is required then it can be selected.
OR
Perhaps have two buttons 1) ""APROVE"" 2) ""APPROVE & EMAIL""

We need to keep to a simple streamlined work load that is logical.",1

Let me just type the date and tab to the next. I dont want to have to constantly be going between the keyboard and mouse. Why have you made the program so much more labour intensive? Listen to those who pay you wages. We pay to use a program that is supposed to make our book keeping simple and easy yet here you are forcing us to use a program that has gone back in time. You state it is making it better but there are thousands of comments on thousands of threads from those who actual use the program stating otherwise.,1

Sorry Xero,  it was good while it lasted,   maybe losing customers to a competitor might finally spur you into listening to your customer base more.",0
Huge relief to have this sorted. Invoicing is actually fast again. 10/10 update.,4
"Hi Kelly,

After reading the below comments I'm not holding out much hope of my issue being resolved any time soon.  However, will leave my thoughts here for you.
Our business deals with Real Estate agents and as you would expect, Real Estates have hundreds of properties on their books that we need to assist with.  It's vital that we can have a single contact on our records but with multiple delivery addresses.  Please tell me it's not going to take another 10 years for this issue to be fixed?",0
Agree with Angela Collins. Not all of your clients 'approve & send'. Give us an easy option to just 'approve'. Please and thank you.,2
"@Nicole Neale ... spot on!! I'm new to this thread, but have been on a few other threads for YEARS!!!

And here we are, another fairly standard function that Xero doesn't provide, and clearly has no intention of providing. Meanwhile, they have a fancy new invoicing system that offers a whole bunch of **** that no one asked for!

I'd say Do Better Xero, but why would I bother?!",0
i eagerly await this feature to be developed. It will really save so much time. thanks,2
Our business really needs this as we have ongoing projects and need to be able to track against full quotes.  Seems that each time I want to automate something in Xero it requires an additional add on which costs more money.  We simply can't afford to keep paying monthly fees.,1
I think xero isn’t really aimed at larger companies with lots of transactions. I suggest moving to another provider who does this better.,3
Another user requesting - it seems a very basic function that would be very useful to us.,1
"Again I like to voice my frustration about Xero's present ""simple"" address management. We just prepared a quote to a client and client requested on the quote the address to be for branch B. So we had to change the client's address to address B and then issue the quote. 

What I did not expect is that this procedure also changes the address on all former and accepted quotes to this client. Quotes are important contractual and legal document forming part of the purchase contract and once a quote is accepted it should never change. At least not unintentionally.",0

It used to have hundreds of votes but this new forum is much more difficult to navigate than the last one so I'm guessing a lot of users can't find this to vote on it again... or they have just lost the will to try after so many years....",0
The '.' still does not seem to work in the invoice date field?  The '/' works fine.,2
Where did you hear that's it's being implemented? It would be great news if it is.,4
"My Thoughts

Reason for Feature Development
1. Professional Presentation for Clients

Many businesses want to present clean, summary-style invoices to clients without exposing detailed internal breakdowns (e.g., markup, subcontractor fees, individual material costs).
Currently, to avoid showing certain line items, businesses must manually merge or delete them, which complicates record keeping and audit trails.
2. Maintain Accurate Internal Reporting

Businesses often use detailed line items for internal analysis, job costing, and tracking. Hiding items from the client-facing invoice while retaining them in the backend would preserve data integrity without compromising client presentation.
3. Competitive Sensitivity

In trades, consulting, and contracting industries, line items may reveal sensitive supplier costs, margins, or proprietary service breakdowns. Hiding them prevents price shopping and protects intellectual property.
4. Industry Standards

Competitor software (e.g., QuickBooks, FreshBooks, and Zoho Books) offer “summary invoices,” “collapsible line items,” or “internal notes only.” To stay competitive, Xero should match this flexibility.
5. Enhanced Customisation and Control

Businesses increasingly demand invoice customisation. Adding this feature would improve user satisfaction, especially among trades, agencies, and firms who need tailored client communication.",1
"Why does the focus no longer go to ""Contact"" when ""Save and add another""?",2
Love this update! Saved me hours of data entry this week alone. Brilliant work.,4
We often receive order's from one customer(partner) but deliver is to a difference customer(partners Customer) how can do this in Zero?,2
"Why does XERO autofill the ""payment date"" to some weird date? Eg: I'm paying wages today (4 June 2024) and Xero autofills the payment date to 18 May 2024. If I didn't pick on this then IRD would fine us $250 for late filing and payment (trust me I've been burnt twice on this very issue). Xero should not autofill the payment date but leave it blank for us to fill in.",1
"Kelly, it’s been 7 months and an update is needed.  I think it’s important to communicate regularly on the progress.  You have indicated that you are WORKING ON THIS and therefor 7 months of programming should have even enough time to make this correction/improvement.  I know that some of these requests need to be coded using a more modern platform but fur USER EXPERIENCE & LOYALITY Xero needs to communicate the progress.  

Please check all the suggests you have commented on and PROVIDE AN UPDATE, even if the task has taken you longer than expected.",0
"In the new invoicing mode, when you copy an invoice for a customer, those customer's default payment terms (default due date) is not used. Can this be rectified? Have been using the old invoicing style to copy invoices to date, concerned that using the old invoicing is being deactivated shortly.",2

Agree with Benjamin on 16.08.22 - this is such a basic feature. Time to move a batch of clients back to Sage - hugely embarrassing and a complete waste of time.,0
"This feature request has been ongoing since 2012. During this period, Xero removed the original dates from the discussion thread, and to make matters worse, they also deleted the original comments on this new ""Products Idea"" forum. Unfortunately, my comment is missing, so I'm reposting it here.

The issue is that if you do work for a big organisation with hundreds of employees and you are running multiple projects you can't invoice individual people or departments under the same organisation. I know you can add extra contacts but this still doesn't work, as I need the statements generated to ONLY include projects to that relevant team member.

I have resorted to fudging the company name by adding periods in various locations, for example:

Business Name PM Pty Ltd
Business Name PM Pty Ltd.
Business Name PM Pty. Ltd
Business Name PM Pty. Ltd.
Business Name PM. Pty Ltd
Business Name PM. Pty Ltd.
Business Name PM. Pty. Ltd.
Business Name. PM Pty Ltd

This is NOT a very elegant way of managing it and I have also run out of options!

Xero please advise if you are listening to your customers and if this will ever make it onto your roadmap.",0
"I can't believe Xero hasn't thought about this when creating this software. Customers would require different delivery address to manage inventory. 
Also it updates the address to all invoiced/quotes for the particular customer. It's very hard to trust the system and have to keep separate system to ensure orders are shipped to correct address. Not sure why it is taking so long for Xero developers to add a field and make it operational.",0
"We now have new invoicing, where is the ability to add more contacts? If it was available in the back end in April 2024 why has it not been pushed out with new invoicing?",2
Thanks for the heads up. This saves us from having to use the reference field for street addresses.,3
"Hi Tjaart van der Walt

Love your post. It is so true, but I could not stop laughing until I read the part about increasing prices.",2
Thank goodness! No more manual typing on packing slips. You are a life saver.,4
"Reading over these comments is laughable. How is adding an extra contact field taking months and months. Xero could easily be the number one option in the accounting software space, but missing some very basic options holds it back. Such a shame.",0
This is fantastic news. The multiple delivery address feature works perfectly and is super fast.,4
"many of our customers are large organizations (like universities). While all the bills for invoices to different departments are paid by the university, we invoice the individual departments separately, and they all have separate contact information (emails, phone, mailing addresses). 

In Quickbooks, we used ""Jobs"" (which are basically folders inside the customer), for each department. Each Job could have its own contact info. Something like that would be welcome. As it is now, we have to have 22 separate customers just for one university, because that's how many departments we work with. Even though the checks for all of those come from the same place.",2
"Hi Kelly, please can you give us a rough of idea of how much longer we will have to wait for this?",2
"The ability to change the primary contact without re-entering it would also be appreciated. Contacts change all the time, I should be able to mark another contact as primary which unchecks the existing primary person.",2
"A Unit of measure of mm is crucial. And I am pretty sure I know how Xero can cater to the needs of any unit.

You've gotta ask how you measure a unit at the start and for stocktake.

When I get units in, it is in mm, so when it starts, I change a setting from Units of Unit to mm increments, from there I say how many mm I acquire and then between here and stocktake, this is the data that is required for reporting purposes.

When assessing how to track this, ideally you need to know how to accommodate it, and when you know the item and you know the unit, you can see ""Units sold"" and it's 50 units is equal to 50mm based on the Original setting for that item versus say a physical item of a filter which 50 units would be a Unit qty of 50 of these.

Either way, it's 50 and 50, 50 qty of either, but 50 in a different metric of units from Unit to metric milimetres.

I support this feature and unfortunately this will be the achilies heel for my business operations which run on exactly the metric measurement which is difficult to implement without paying $200.00 per month which would wipe out all profits unfortunately.

Doing things harder at this point is working smarter.",1
"Building on this request, it would also be extremely helpful to have the ability to choose which linked person under a single business contact is used when creating quotes or invoices. Many businesses work with multiple individuals at the same company, and being able to select the correct person (rather than defaulting to the primary contact) would greatly improve accuracy and tracking.",4
Any update ????????,1
"So... our pathetic solution is to create multiple accounts for the same client but add a full stop or 2 to their name. Disgusting solution, God forbid they ask for a monthly statement!",0
"For the love of all things holy!! It cant be that hard to allow for postal and delivery addresses in a new contact field then have a checkbox on the invoice to direct who to address it to. It looks sooo unproffesional when you send a contact a quote/invoice with someone elses details on it because your under time pressure and havent updated the entire address field to suit the different contacts within a single organisation.

Have dealt with it in good faith this far but am finally fully and officially over it now. Please hurry with this upgrade.",1
"This is definitely a critical function for the most of sole traders, don't understand why you guys haven't been designed it yet.",1
So happy with this. It cleans up my contacts list instantly. No more duplicate names!,4
"@ Xero, this is a VERY basic function that your customers are requesting. Not having this function impacts on our ability to service OUR customers, and it makes us look incompetent. We are tired of having to provide our customer with the excuse, ""Our accounting software doesn't have that function"". This basic function has been available with Quickbooks Online for over 12 years. I personally regret switching to XERO at the suggestion of my accountant. XERO is clearly tailored to meet the needs of accountants and is completely out-of-touch with the needs of it's end-users. I'm so sick of this ****. I want to go back to Quickbooks.",0
Excellent.,3
This feature is incredible. It handles our multi-site customers with ease. Thank you!,4
"A year on - nearly 500  clients crying out for a solution and still nothing from Xero.
This feature (multiple delivery addresses) already exists in the Purchase Order screen, so it should be relatively straightforward to enable something similar for invoicing (if of course there is a will to do it.....) 
Shockingly slow effort from Xero.",0
Xero allows us to connect with so many apps - it would be great to have a couple of custom fields to allow us to i) keep records among different aps that relate to a specific customer and 2) allow us to add merged fields from a connected app.,3
"The lack of this feature alone is enough to consider an alternative software package.

The idea that managers need to hunt down invoices requiring their approval by logging in multiple times per day / week, particularly around month end, to see if anything is there for them is quite frankly ridiculous and a waste of managers time.",0
"Because I can't create an invoice that calculates quantity, price, and number of months (custom field), I have to create invoices manually for some services. Xero seemed like a great application, but the more I learn, the more disappointing it is to see that adding a custom field to the invoice is not on the roadmap in 2025.",1
"Chiming in to say that not having subtotal ability is what will make me jump ship with Xero. I am definitely feeling the pain from transitioning away from Quickbooks, and this may be the deal breaker. The add-ons and the subscriptions to make simple things work are hard to take.",0
"@Kelly. Great news. Question - will multiple 'client' email addresses flow through to tax payments module to issue tax payment letters for multiple recipients (i.e. the same way that the main email does now, just with more addresses)? That was one of the key reasons for multiple email addresses applicable to all NZ practices anyhow.",3
Finally! I've been waiting for this for years and it works exactly like I hoped. Thank you!,4
Thank goodness! No more manual typing on packing slips. You are a life saver.,4
"We are at risk of breaching a clients confidentiality as we aren't able to restrict clients files, timesheets, invoices only Tax and Xero Files. Would love to also be able to chose which person can't rather than all the ones that can (have both options) and also to restrict a whole Client Group as well as just each individual/entity",2
10 days until classic (includes this function) is retired....,2
This is a massive improvement. It makes Xero the best option on the market again.,4
"Kelly, Thats music to my years...can you please add me to the contact list when this features is available.
We are a wholesaler and send fabric to customers who have multiple address for their 1. designers who may be working remotely[ more often , these days] . Their 2. bulk warehouse where the contact holds goods for future processing. 3.Fabric cutters who are a different company 4. Overseas destinations.
We currently have to put these address into Xero as a Item so that the information as already in the system and data entry mistakes aren't made but it is a bit crazy esp when the rudimentary Xero reports will include the Item in reports that then make the report meaningless or just inaccurate for mamangement information.
rt",4
"Hi Kelly, it's great you are working on this. 

I'm frustrated by the restriction of address fields to 2 only.

Below is my recent email to your support team.

We have many customers with more than 2 addresses, as below

1) Shop address
2) warehouse address
3) Billing address

However we are only able to add 2 addresses to the Contact Details page, which means valuable information is missing from their Contact records.

Can you please add an extra address field into the Contact Details Section?",3
"I've had to workaround this issue with separate contact cards for each site (and in some cases, for each project with a different person that invoices need to be marked attention to)... That then requires custom reports and statements.",2
Hi - can you tell me if this is possible in WorkFlow Max also? Thanks,2
"Small group of companies. Parent company and 4 subsidiaries with very similar structure and in the same business. Need to report on consolidated (combined) performance wrt. AR, AP and general business analytics. We spend more time to export and consolidate outside of Xero, while all the helpful business snapshot reports are only available individual. Individual reports are not accurate as transactions occurs across entities",2
Please add this to the UK payroll!,2
Great Idea,4
Put it on your roadmap urgently,2
Thank goodness! No more manual typing on packing slips. You are a life saver.,4
Thanks so much :-),4
Appreciate the communication on this. It looks like the new feature will cover our needs for clients with multiple branches.,3
This looks promising. It handles the basic requirement of separate shipping addresses well.,3
Please allow me to use void invoice number. Mistake happens sometime and we need to fix it,2
"Michelle - potential work around (not ideal but might save you time).  Make up a draft invoice (or draft quote) that can be easily copied to create a new invoice.  In this draft, make up your 42 lines but adding just 1 dot in the description field in each line.   Keep this draft as your template.  When it's time to make up an invoice, copy the template to create a new invoice - you can then paste in repeatedly into the lines you want  to overwrite the dot you originally put in.     If you're able to use a Produce or Service as your standard lines you put in repeatedly, even better.",2
VERY IMPORTANT,1
We will not jump on-board till this issue is addressed,0
"@Xero - any update? This is more important than trying to push us onto a New Invoicing that no one wants. 

Please, listen to your people rather than looking for new customers with 90% off sales",2
So happy with this. It cleans up my contacts list instantly. No more duplicate names!,4
The inbuilt calculator is not at all helpful to address this issue,1
"Can't believe I jsut switched 2 businesses over to Xero just to find out that this ESSENTIAL feature is non-existent. Such an big let down, their customer service has been great and I was so happy to find a good bookkeeping platform and now, I have to find a new program so I can accept partial payments. This is such a basic necessity for every small business.",3
"New Invoicing - 'Find Address' field & 'Attention' field

We need the find address field as this helps verify the correct address was given by the customer.

We need the attention field as this is useful for notes other than the address (contact, c/-, contact number etc etc).",2
This is a must release feature in my opinion,1
This is incredibly important - we have many customers with multiple service locations and some of these customers won't accept Xero invoices due to the fact we can't show the service location address on the invoice unless we update it on the system every single time which is time consuming when Xero is supposed to be making our lives easier!,0
Thanks Xero team. Tested the new function today and it seems stable. Definitely saves a bit of admin time.,3
I have found Kelly Munro from Xero on linked in and have messaged her directly to ask about when this feature will be implemented?  it will be interesting to see if i get a reply. may be all of us should contact her through linked in to ask about this decade old issue!!,0
"Love it, love it, love it. No more messy workarounds or using the reference field!",4
This is fantastic such a time saver!! Are there any plans to implement this in bills as well? Again this would be a huge time saver being able to not have to keep moving from keyboard to mouse and back for every single bill.,4
"I used to love xero. I told everyone I could about it. now I actually have come to hate parts of it. It's tech driven not customer centric. I would switch in a second if I heard of a better one, but I'm too busy to look and listen. My loss.. Plus the owner bought himself a 60million dollar home. Go figure. The new version is forced on us and i really HATE it. Everything takes longer. Its not logical. Let us use both.",0
Fantastic work on this release. It's solved our biggest headache overnight.,4
I Have been weighting since 2019 for this functionality!!! still nothing. we have this functionality in purchase orders so how hard can it be.  i am exploring new software that has this function.  i cant wait for ever for Xero to sharpen up and bring out this feature!!,0
"YES! We so need to do this. Xero contacts is fine when your client is an individual with two residential addresses but when your main client is a corporate and your dealing with various staff or departments, there are very limited fields to use. I've just tried to add the details (mobile, email and title) of an accounts person at a building company that we work with, and 1) I can't enter all these fields ""Their Title"", and 2), I already have 5 contacts under the client and can't add any more. This happens all the time, and we are a small business.",2
"Incredible... it's taking more than 12 years to implement such a fundamental and basic function?!

The complete absence of communication regarding the status of this request is simply unacceptable. 

Customers have been left in the dark, unsure whether their concerns are even being considered, let alone addressed. This lack of transparency breeds frustration and erodes trust in your brand.

It is evident that Xero's priorities are misplaced, focusing more on acquiring new customers rather than prioritising the needs and concerns of existing ones.
 
Customers who have invested time and resources into your platform expect better treatment and... respect!",0
Auditors frequently ask for this information.,2
"Hey Kelly, thank you for the updates. We appreciate you!

Is there a quarter on your roadmap for when this feature has been allocated to?

Also, just checking if this also means that the address selected for an invoice will persist with that invoice, even after a contact adds a new address in the future?",4
"Never mind, found it. That is perfect thank you",3
"I've been a user for a couple of months now and I've already seen the admins say ""nah, we have no plan to do that"" to two ridiculously easy to implement changes that would save users immense amounts of time. Like, your intern could knock this out during your lunch break. Seriously WTF?!",0
This is a solid improvement. Being able to add a secondary address for delivery without editing the main contact is useful.,3
"Love it, love it, love it. No more messy workarounds or using the reference field!",4
"This is the single WORST thing Xero can do. NOWHERE ON EARTH uses a Gregorian Calendar of Monday-Sunday. ENDLESS errors are being made - and WHY?
Why in the heck would your team think fixing the absolute UNIVERSAL standard of a Gregorian calendar display is a good idea?
PUT IT BACK TO SUNDAY - SATURDAY.
I can't believe that anyone at Xero thinks this is helpful.",0
"Hi Everyone, I also urgently need this feature building in as standard. I love Xero but my client is less than convinced due to this missing  multiple delivery address feature. Hope it gets sorted soon !",3
"Any update on TTR's? As mentioned below several times, it would be very handy for winding up deceased estates.",2
@Anya Pagden using a non tracking product will make the shipping address show up on the invoice and packing slip and as it's not tracking it wont affect your inventory. All you need to do is use a logical number system for the part number. e.g. DEL-XYZL01-001. The 2nd and 3 part of the part number relate to the customer account reference and address sequence. if you have 10 delivery addresses it would go all the way upto 010.,2
"Having read Xero's poor stance on support of such a significantly key feature, has resulted in my firm deciding to migrate from Xero to Sage.

Fortunately there is a Cloud Convert feature whereby you migrate from Xero to Sage for free with 2 years' data.

Www.cloudconvert.co.za

Let's see if Xero misses my 291 subscriptions that I am moving to Sage next month.... And then hopefully take it as a lesson learnt to listen to their clients.

Converting back from Sage to Xero again later? I won't have the energy to come back. Been a good 8 years, but Sage's intercompany feature is excellent and my only resort.",0
Thanks Xero team. Tested the new function today and it seems stable. Definitely saves a bit of admin time.,3
"Hello XERO! Please make this possible by this quarter! This feature is very critical! There is an option to choose multiple addresses in Purchase but NOT in SALES. How come???

I am looking forward to this feature very soon!!!",0
Glad to see this is finally being addressed. The ability to select a different address on the invoice screen helps our workflow.,3
"I have discovered that there is now a ""Review and Pay"" button on statements.

It will only appear if the invoice is new. I have found that you can prompt it to show in older statements by ""editing"" an invoice. You don't need to edit anything, you just need to make Xero think you have edited the invoice.",2
"I've requested this several times over the last 6 years. I was told about 5 years ago it was about to be released. never happened. 
In my opinion its one of the biggest issues with Xero",1
"Hey Marianne I have just come across this issue and found a quick resolution. You can highlight the text above the table, where it says ""Total"" and Status"". You can then drag down to the bottom of the table of data, copy and paste into a spreadsheet and there you have it.

It took me grabbing one of our software developers and me showing him the issue for me to then just highlight above it and get the resolution myself!",3
Game changer for our construction projects. Invoicing for different sites is a breeze now.,4
"It has actually been over 10 years since this feature was requested. No update as to when this could be added and suggests that no development has been done in Bills for a long time as it could easily be incorporated into an update. It is standard practice for Purchase Order reference to be linked to a bill, but Xero expects this to be added into the line detail. This is a very backward approach for a forward thinking company. It may seem trivial, but if you are dealing with this for hundreds of bills a week/month, the benefits of Xero start to get outweighed by the daily functionality of other options.",1
Appreciate getting this sorted. It makes matching the delivery docket to the invoice much simpler.,3
"This is exactly what I wanted to see from xero especially with the price increases. Please let me know if I can help guinea pig ;-) 

I'm really looking forward to what you guys come up with. 

Keep up the good work xero~",4

Seems that this really is a priority for many Xero users now. Any update?,2
I am about to migrate to MYOB because of this and their inventory system is much better. Plus its alot cheaper!! Adios amigos :-),0
Excellent.,3
"Hi Kelly,

The comments below are not directed at you personally, just Xero & are borne from extreme frustration.

Thank you for the update, but talk about getting the cart before the horse, wouldn't the survey BEFORE you started changing everything been a better idea!!!!

You've not mentioned extending the availability of Classic, so can only assume that New Invoicing is going to be forced on us on the 27th in the hope that we will get used to it & stop complaining.  Never going to happen!!

It's not like we are asking for the moon or anything, we just want the functionality & efficiency we currently have with Classic.

What I don't understand is that you could totally revamp the suppliers module (to make it the nightmare it is) without having to change the input screen, so why is this different??

Or is changing that the next little surprise you have instore for us??

Your telling us that Xero is listening, but I'm yet to see any evidence of that.

I used to love your product, now I am starting to hate it & if things continue down the same path as they have with all the changes over the last 12 months, I think I will be moving on & taking my 29 clients with me.",0
So happy with this. It cleans up my contacts list instantly. No more duplicate names!,4
"This is even more important now that the leave dated has been dropped from the employee history screen since an upgrade.

"I stopped offering Xero to most clients in 2018, then stopped altogether a couple years later. Micro businesses/PSCs use FreeAgent, everyone else with greater size/complexity is on Quickbooks. Recently some have gone to Sage.

This issue, the (lack of) duplicate contact names, and the credit note problem, are significantly inconvenient and time-consuming.",0
"I think xero is overthinking this.  The way it works in quickbooks and others is you can freeform paste in a shipping address during invoice creating.  Since our clients jobs (contruction) go from address to address, it is not important to keep this info in a record beyond just the invoice.

Let me repeat: we have customers where the shipping invoice is NEVER the same and it changes EVERY bill.

What most people are doing now in xero is adding it to the reference field or pasting in a ""freight"" item line.  So why not just have an optionally-filled ship to line that can be pasted into as customers are already doing with these workarounds??",0

"Well just over a month to go before they supposably close of Classic Invoicing and force all users to use an inferior user interface.

Have they listened to any users? Nope, still have not got New to anywhere near like the functionality and efficient layout of the Classic - actually the name sames its Classic -  judged over a period of time to be of the highest quality and outstanding of its kind.

Now on their, Xero, web site they say: We’re with you every step of the way
Our new and improved invoicing has been designed to bring you more flexibility and customization options – and help you get paid on time. We’re committed to evolving every product we offer, to create the best experience for our customers now, and into the future.

That is a lot of political cover up in my opinion and based on continual comments coming through I think a lot of users will agree.

They even go further and say: As always, your feedback is essential, so please share your thoughts on Xero Product Ideas. Your input ensures new invoicing can continue to meet and we hope, exceed your expectations as we evolve it. Please check out Xero Central for the latest updates and helpful resources. 

Have they (Xero) listened to users feedback - don't think so, still same old issues keep coming through on feedback including no proper history tracking, payment detail at top of invoice (Xero keep pushing for getting users to use their payment system - get paid quicker - will I don't want to so stop trying to push something onto me - its like spam in my opinion - would like to push this to the Commerce Commission - might be an idea.)

Anyway - I will stick with Classic until it dies - but must say Xero, users are not happy and I don't see how your shareholders can be - given you haven't paid them a dividend yet - as far as i know - and will this push to New drop the share price - it would in my opinion.

Ok, back to work on Classic invoice for a new sale - quick and easy in Classic horrible and time consuming in New :(.",0
"They're VERY busy working on SUPER important updates... like changing the appearance of the invoicing UI for absolutely ZERO benefit to actual bookkeepers... why would they prioritize functionality over making our screens work against us and each tiny function just a little bit slower to make our days in the office more complicated and less efficient?

12 years isn't that long! Can't you see this vital change has been logged as ""in development""? That means they're working on it and we shall just have to wait a little longer, fingers crossed before we're all retired.",1
"Completely agree with Kim and William on this one - the deafening silence from Xero is shocking. I note that after a few adverse comments on another issue (Show contacts on one page) the thread was ""closed"" recently - Xero said contributors were going off topic.... so I suspect the same will happen to this one shortly too. The new CEO (Sukhinder Singh Cassidy) promised more openness but when I wrote to her, I received a message back from her ""team"" (the people I was complaining about) repeating the same old platitudes, before presumably sending my comments to the recycling bin.
This feature (multiple delivery addresses) already exists as a feature on the Purchase Order screen, so it can't be difficult to implement, I am therefore left with no other option but to conclude that Xero don't want to do it for some reason and are not being honest in their (2) replies? Perhaps they are looking at a ""cost v benefit"" analysis that tells them they won't lose too many clients by not doing anything so it won't affect their bottom line too much - or am I being too cynical? Either way, I won't be recommending Xero to anyone until the situation changes for the better and as soon as practical will be moving to another platform with better customer service.
Sukhinder needs to get across this - I don't think they realise how angry their clients are about being fobbed off, patronised and ignored in this way.",0
"One more thought ... 
There is another company, Microsoft, who had (arguably) a great software product at one point, but destroyed that potential because (in part) they employed the ideas of ""change for the sake of change"" and ""any change must be for the benefit of the shareholders, not the users"". 
If you look at a modern Microsoft product, its mostly advertising, no real progress on key features, and many many features lost including stability and security. Anti-malware is almost unheard of in Mac and Linux, but mandatory for windows. UI speed is worse despite the fastest chips in history and huge amounts of available RAM, and local search is slower then ever, with ""progress"" bars that don't actually mean anything. This is where Xero is heading.

Do you remember Microsoft tried to get rid of the start menu? They claimed that their telemetry showed that ""few people used the start menu""
In Invoicing, its not rocket science to understand that most users will create an invoice and email it. In ""New"" invoicing, emailing that invoice has been pushed from a dedicated button, to a link hidden in a submenu. This is Xero's ""get rid of the start menu"" moment, and shows how dedicated they are to enshitifying the product.
Microsoft's drive was to remove the start menu so that a full page ""app picker"" would be the standard way to start apps - because then, you have the real estate to show ads. That's what it was all about - enshitifying the experience , making it much worse for users, in return for a few cents of advertising revenue for shareholders of microsoft.",1
"I am glad it has been added to the 'New' invoicing feature, but can't it also send an email without being an extra step or going to the invoicing menu.",2
Analytics are amazing but can add confusion for clients so having the fav reports primary they do not get lost in the menu. love the analytics reports and educating the clients more around them,3
Love this! So many small businesses come to me after having done this and it is a mess!,4
"Is there a progress report? My growing business now has a national client with 26 branches and now I find that Xero doesn't have a workable solution for parent & child sales accounts? Would have thought that it would have been a high priorty for Xero as those of us at the operational end of our businesses find this a critical and fundamental gap in Xero. But I see some have been waiting 10 years for the solution. Can only mean that the boffins either don't see the problem, or the solution? Hopefully I am wrong and Xero can commit to a ""go live"" date?",1
