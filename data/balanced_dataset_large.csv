Thank you :) This will make the finalisation of deceased estates and vesting of trusts so much easier.,3
Would be helpful if you had the ability to change the dashboard graphs to show YTD as well.,2
"I am really surprised there are not notifications to approvers when an invoice awaits approval. It means someone has to contact me outside the system, then I go into Xero to look for it, then go back out to let the person know I approved it. I expected the feature to exist.",1
This is incredibly important - we have many customers with multiple service locations and some of these customers won't accept Xero invoices due to the fact we can't show the service location address on the invoice unless we update it on the system every single time which is time consuming when Xero is supposed to be making our lives easier!,0
"I have xero integrated with my capsule crm and would like for xero to have the multiple addresses, so it can sync correctly when identifying and updating. At present my CRM allows for multiple addresses for a customer, but xero just creates new contacts so I end up with many of the same name.",2
"I currently have a free trial, I like the look of xero over competition at present, but This is looking ot be a deal breaker.
We often have 30 or more items on the invoice plus lines for labour costs, we want to be able to describe the service carried out (which can be done in the description field) but not show line items of individual spares or materials, we just need a total for the client.
Pointless paying for email invoicing with payment links if we have to use a seperate invoicing software so the invoices can be sent as we need.",0
"Hi Kelly, It has now been a year since this update - where is this solution at now? We are looking at moving from MYOB but this is CRITICAL to our operations and there doesn't seem to be any work around available while we are waiting for the software update. We cannot be sending 2 dozen separate statements to customers who operate the one account with us. Failing the update - IS there a workaround? Can we manually change the delivery address? Bill one contact but select a second to deliver to?",1
"Now 13 years later, this is still not implemented.  Xero must have the resources to fix this.  It is quite normal for invoiced to include a date delivered column.  This should be simple to implement and useful for a a lot of customers.  Please don't succumb to inshitification now that you have captured the market...",1
I see the flashy ads and advertising at sporting events and think if Xero only spent more money on basic product features they would get so many more customers just by 'word of mouth'. Currently I advise any business contacts I have to avoid Xero like the plague. :-(,0
YES! FINALLY!!!! I have been using my own custom made template for this for ages - seems crazy to send a client a statement with 10+ outstanding invoices on it and expect them to open each invoice and click the links separately...! this pay now feature is well overdue. thank you Xero! I am v sad I didn't get to try it out though... hopefully in the next pool??!,4
"A classic important detail: Most of our customers have a contract address which is different to the invoice address. So this is really needed.
",2
This is huge for us. Our dispatch team is celebrating not having to check addresses manually!,4
"Is there any update on this please? I have a client wanting to change software but they won't use Xero unless this key feature is in place. They're looking at other software options, so I just wanted to check whether timescales are known before they look to commit elsewhere? Thanks.",1
If classic invoicing is retired on the 27th without new invoicing being fixed (ie the features we need from old invoice work in new) then i'm leaving and taking my orgs somewhere else (that will be 4 orgs),0
"Any update ????????

",1
"Yes still waiting - but they will spend time changing the sales invoices into a way we don’t want them for no reason, but ignore the points that actually need to be worked on like this!",1
This looks promising. It handles the basic requirement of separate shipping addresses well.,3
"I am so disappointed that Xero missed this function.... All people here in Australia working in the healthcare industry need it. I just signed up with Xero and will spend another couple of days trying to figure this out. If I can't solve it, I am changing to MYOB",1
Whilst I continue to use Xero I do not recommend it to others. In fact I disrecommend it. Customer focus and response is very poor. This particular topic has dragged on for years. The lack of action by Xero show how out of touch their senior management is from customers of their in the field.,0
"Hi Xero Team, 
Not long to go now before the 12 month anniversary of your post made on the 30th April 2024, which advised that you were working on the future returns function for company returns over the next 12 months. Where are we at?",1
"QB has this feature in their payrun, it makes it superfast and easy to process for payday super",2
"How is this feature taking so long to implement?!
It's really very critical for any business which provides physical goods...

If there's some sort of difficulty in implementing this fully, how about Xero adds a field where a one-time use address can be added on a per-invoice basis?

If we can specify different delivery addresses on purchase orders, (as we're expected to need multiple delivery addresses), why is it so hard to have a similar feature on invoices, (as if customers are only allowed to operate from one location)..?

Please Xero, listen to your customers, Just. Get. It. Sorted.",0
"https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/xero-navigation/nimnmopdaaicppnngkapackhkfpjhgna
Above Chrome extension could help with the Xero navigation, feel free to use and suggestions are welcome.",3
It’s a decent update. The drop-down menu on the new invoicing screen is handy and works as expected.,3
"Lol - it is clear that Xero ignores this chat. 

The feature would be excellent.  Maybe someone should start the chat on LinkedIn; it may garner some attention if we move the conversation there.   Otherwise, the product overall is good. 

It would be nice if they had a product team that engaged users from time to time. I don't think they have account managers to check in with customers.  Sad, if I treated my customers like this, I would not have any!

I'll check back here in another 5 years!",1
Critical need for us too - Date and period should be separate fields/options in the system - it's the only way to enable accurate reporting.,2
"Nah not 3 years. I requested this back 10 years ago minimum. They just keep changing the forums and merging and changing the date so it doesn't look like it's been so long. The old threads on this topic had 100s of replies if not more that were ""lost"".",0
"Very critical for SMEs in Singapore. Please add more email addresses. Currently, the maximum is 10 only for Quote and invoice, as we need to send to our customers and suppliers, who have multiple departments and personnel to address.",2
"This should be a no brainer!!!!

This would save your users a lot of time and frustration. Makes me want to go back to MYOB",0
"Yes! At the moment we can filter by staff member but they're not even in date order.  Filter by date, filter by supplier within each staff member would be common sense.  We have a huge list linked to multiple credit cards and it's so hard to find particular ones.",2
"Kelly, Thats music to my years...can you please add me to the contact list when this features is available.
We are a wholesaler and send fabric to customers who have multiple address for their 1. designers who may be working remotely[ more often , these days] . Their 2. bulk warehouse where the contact holds goods for future processing. 3.Fabric cutters who are a different company 4. Overseas destinations.
We currently have to put these address into Xero as a Item so that the information as already in the system and data entry mistakes aren't made but it is a bit crazy esp when the rudimentary Xero reports will include the Item in reports that then make the report meaningless or just inaccurate for mamangement information.
rt",4
"As my mum used to say : ""You've got 2 hopes - Bob Hope and No Hope!"". lol

I've been waiting for this update in Xero for almost 10 years (my boss won't let me move to a different programme - long story).

Besides, even if Xero eventually do role it out, it will probably be a complete shambles like the New Reports which are not fit for purpose.",0
"Having read Xero's poor stance on support of such a significantly key feature, has resulted in my firm deciding to migrate from Xero to Sage.

Fortunately there is a Cloud Convert feature whereby you migrate from Xero to Sage for free with 2 years' data.

Www.cloudconvert.co.za

Let's see if Xero misses my 291 subscriptions that I am moving to Sage next month.... And then hopefully take it as a lesson learnt to listen to their clients.

Converting back from Sage to Xero again later? I won't have the energy to come back. Been a good 8 years, but Sage's intercompany feature is excellent and my only resort.",0
"Couldn't agree more,  we raised this and commented about it a number of times.   Im now face with the proposition that we must have approvers in the process,  so looks like we may have out grown Xero, finally and will need to move to something more capable as a business tool.

Sorry Xero,  it was good while it lasted,   maybe losing customers to a competitor might finally spur you into listening to your customer base more.",0
"If we can have the option of choosing the delivery address from a drop down list, it will be great. ",2
"As a new user of Xero, I'm surprised that what I thought would be a standard feature of accounting software isn't available; yet the issue has been highlighted by so many people, over many years. Surely something so simple could be added, considering how much the monthly fee increases year-on-year.",1
I think xero isn’t really aimed at larger companies with lots of transactions. I suggest moving to another provider who does this better.,3
"Pleased to see some bulk changes can now be made on the Job Manager table, hopefully the ability to change the job status this way is not far off as it would be so useful for us.",2
"We kept switching back to the classic invoicing and didn't realise this feature was unavailable until now! Very annoying considering we operate through 4 companies and need to invoice management fees through each.
Hopefully this is resolved, or we may look at switching companies too!",0
"Hope to see the solution live soon. It's a common feature in all software.
Thank you for your speedily work on it to solve it.

Thank you",4
"Jodi Herbein,

Yes, I checked it. And the payment terms were applied correctly! However, the warning pop-up window is still there. Maybe they forgot to remove it?",3
This was announced that you would be reverting the payroll pricing in December 2024 yet here we are in April 2025 and still no update on this. That is a lot of money people have practically wasted waiting on this being corrected. Any further forward with this before people start leaving Xero completely,0
"Hello Kelly Munro not a convincing answer to the problem. This has been an issue for several years.  I am in the process of transitioning to Xero from Reckons and thank heavens found out early that there is no column for service date. Shocked and deeply disappointed!!!  We are a service base company that attend to businesses in hospitality, age care, just to name a few, multiple times a week  and it essential that we have a column for date of service on our monthly invoice.  When I realised that this not an option, which in fact should be a simple basic feature on an invoice I have decided that I will be remaining with Reckons. To say this is not in your future plans is simply LAZY and CONCEITED!",0
Another disbelief from me that this is not incorporated. Pull the finger out Xero,0
We often receive order's from one customer(partner) but deliver is to a difference customer(partners Customer) how can do this in Zero?,2
"Some really good points here from @SamBond...
I would strongly recommend using the xero api to address these needs.
It is relatively straight forward now to create web pages that interact with the Xero api (which is well documented) and design pages to do just the type of thing you are describing.
It is not ideal and you would expect a competent accounts package to offer the features you are describing.

I run a complete subscription and renewal package via an api web interface, the subscription and subscriber data is stored in a separate database and it links to invoices and quotes raised in xero, I am slowly expanding it to include account interactions like sending reminders and accepting quotes and purchase orders.  

This leaves xero to handle the transactions and manage the financial accounts - rather than let it get too close to my business.

In the attached screenshot of my online subscription business I can see overdue invoices, expiring subscriptions and subscriber status in one shot with all the payment, quotes and invoicing data linked to xero and new quotes are automatically generated in xero when required.",3
"GoCardless is probably one of the worst payment gateways. They’ve just decided to deactivate our account with no prior warning and refused to give us a valid reason. You can imagine the time it will take to resetup all the clients which are currently on direct debit with gocardless.

Upon reading some reviews, it seems a lot of organisations are also facing this same issue. GoCardless apparently deactivated user accounts without warning and without reason. It’s plastered all over the internet with 1 star reviews. Why is Xero even in partnership with a payment gateway with such horrid customer service?

Please implement direct debit payments through Stripe.",1
"MARCH 2023 last update, how about another one!
So viewing this thread you have been looking at introducing this for well over a year, why is not ready yet? With customers suggesting the update over ten years ago.
This is a critical addition needed in the software. I am still in my trial period and will not be purchasing. Unfortunately I have invested many hours of time uploading debtors and creditors and customer contacts etc, and would never have bothered if I knew that you couldn't add multiple delivery addresses.
I have a lot of customers who use multiple delivery addresses and need this information on their invoices. What's even worse than not being able to store multiple delivery addresses, is you allow the ability to edit a delivery address in a new invoice, BUT!! then you apply to all other previous invoices, WHY??.  Every other accountancy software package has this functionality, its a basic must!!! why did I listen to my accountant, when he recommended this product.",0
We will not jump on-board till this issue is addressed,0
"We have about 10 clients that would love to get off of Quickbooks...and on to Xero.  But Xero does not listen to the clients needs.  This feature is a basic requirement for most companies doing B2B transactions.

There are other request we have posted and they are being ignored by Xero development team.  How long will it take to implement those basic ideas.  I guess Xero does not want to improve their software.  What a waste of .... talent, time, money....everything about on this software. 

Mean-time we are on the sidelines..... waiting!",0
I have found Kelly Munro from Xero on linked in and have messaged her directly to ask about when this feature will be implemented?  it will be interesting to see if i get a reply. may be all of us should contact her through linked in to ask about this decade old issue!!,0
"The lack of this feature alone is enough to consider an alternative software package.

The idea that managers need to hunt down invoices requiring their approval by logging in multiple times per day / week, particularly around month end, to see if anything is there for them is quite frankly ridiculous and a waste of managers time.",0
Game changer for our construction projects. Invoicing for different sites is a breeze now.,4
Please see attached email detailing how SAGE invoicing is better as it has more fields. Had we understood the Xero limitations here we may not have moved to Xero. There are a lot of other users asking for more invoice fields. This would be a great enhancement.,1
Thank you for raising this. Yes it is very frustrating having to navigate to My Xero all the time. Please bring this search feature back.,1
"Thanks for the update, but there's not reference to these ongoing issues:

- When are you going to fix the issue with invoice numbering? I'm sick of having to manually determine what the last invoice number was to update when I delete a wrong invoice number. We still just get ""there must be an invoice number"" message and the just-deleted invoice number annoyingly put back in.

- When will you fix the issue with Invoice History and Notes?

These things are deal breakers for a lot of us. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't force us to use new invoicing at the end of February. You're ""new"" system isn't as robust as the classic invoicing. We don't want it! We want the full functionality of what we had. Feel free to keep adding new things no one really wants/asked for, but for the love of all things tech, PLEASE give us back the things we rely on. We do these tasks every single day and you're making it really frustrating to use your product.

Sidenote: when I login and you ask for a 2FA code, can you PLEASE make that field active so I can type the code in WITHOUT having to click or tab to the field. That one feels like a no-brainer to me.",1
The ability to save unlimited addresses per contact is amazing. Thank you so much!,4
"Lisa Diamond- Welcome to Xero product ideas, where important product feature requests go to die.  Or just ignored for decades.  It's been over THIRTEEN years Xero seriously!!",0
"Hugely important, getting to work with big clients with multiple cost centres is tough enough, having to then figure things out in Xero and getting paid needs to be easy.",2
"This is exactly what I wanted to see from xero especially with the price increases. Please let me know if I can help guinea pig ;-) 

I'm really looking forward to what you guys come up with. 

Keep up the good work xero~",4
"@Kelly. Great news. Question - will multiple 'client' email addresses flow through to tax payments module to issue tax payment letters for multiple recipients (i.e. the same way that the main email does now, just with more addresses)? That was one of the key reasons for multiple email addresses applicable to all NZ practices anyhow.",3
This is a solid improvement. Being able to add a secondary address for delivery without editing the main contact is useful.,3
"This should be straightforward for a professional development team, especially since you already have the same function active on another page.",1
Wow I didn't know. Where do I find history and notes?,2
"I transitioned from Sage to Xero a few years ago, largely because Xero was ahead of the curve in many areas. However, the lack of support for multiple addresses under a single contact record has been a significant pain point for my business. Sage handled this feature very well, and it’s disappointing that Xero doesn’t yet offer a comparable solution. 

For example, we work with a client that requires individual invoices for numerous delivery sites. Currently, having to place the delivery address in the reference field is cumbersome and unprofessional. This feels like a fundamental feature that should already be in place.  

I understand the complexity of implementing such a solution, but it’s vital for businesses like mine. While this enhancement might not bring immediate revenue, it will undoubtedly help retain your loyal customers and improve user satisfaction.

Please please can this 2nd reference field be added to Bills soon! Duplicate payments have been made because of this oversight. 10 years of asking and counting.... please....,1
Agreed with all. Please add an option to opt out of email notification. Thank you!,2
"We use categories on our invoicing to assist with reporting on multiple divisions.  These categories are set up in our Contacts and used to populate the field on each line item automatically in Classic Invoicing.  

Unfortunately, this is no longer the case with New Invoicing, and I have just had to click into each category field on each line of a 40 line invoice to then select the category entry!

We have invoices that also need to have a project selected in a similar fashion.  

It's just absurd that, in the new and ""improved"" invoicing system does not include a way to allocate the whole invoice to a category and/or project!

This approach, along with so many other issues previously documented in this discussion by so many, is not an acceptable invoicing process and has us seriously considering the merits of continuing to use Xero.",0
"This would be super helpful for our business as well. Our terms are broken up to in 3 payments 30% deposity, 30% at installation and 40% at completion.",2
If I had known that Xero didn't have this basic functionality I would have gone with a different program. As soon as I find a better program I'm switching,0
"I agree. Having 2 approve buttons would be great. Or the ability to set a default per contact would be amazing. Maybe make it smarter, and if an email address is entered on the contact then I want to email it. If there is no email address then it's obvious I don't want to email it.

Also, you mentioned in the email today that the date picker has been improved, but not on the add payment screen. That still takes ages compared to before. Classic used to be Tab x 3, Press 1 or 2 to select the right account, then click Add Payment. Took about a second. Now everything is click, click, click, click, click, click. So inefficient. There is the ability to type in the account box, but you need to click the box first, and then it doesn't auto select the top option, still needs to be clicked again, so what is the point?",1
"I think Xero is pathetic in this area, as every other decent accounting package has this as standard in such as RECKON, MYOB, QUICKBOOKS and many more. Your customers have been asking for this for years, how much longer do we have to wait? Xero is good but should we move onto something that streamlines our business much more effectively and up with the times of most accounting packages. Regards Darryl ",0
"Hi Kelly, any update?  As other posters point out, Sage and QuickBooks have this basic feature as standard.  Regrettably, I'm at the point now where I feel there is no alternative other than to move clients off Xero and back to Sage/QB. ",1
"Can all those here who really would benefit from this idea, bombard this page with this request so maybe then XERO will take some action! You would think this isn't such a difficult feature to add to the system with other systems having had implemented this a while ago... 

XERO we want to be able to do progress payments, please do something about it. Thanks",1
Agreed. How has this not been implemented yet. Seem's like such a basic fix.,2
"Sub account is something quickbook has and it works great for multiple retail locations under 1 parent HQ or 1 MNC with multiple departments.

It should be an easy implementation and hope Xero can do this asap!",3
Agree with Benjamin on 16.08.22 - this is such a basic feature. Time to move a batch of clients back to Sage - hugely embarrassing and a complete waste of time.,0
"So... our pathetic solution is to create multiple accounts for the same client but add a full stop or 2 to their name. Disgusting solution, God forbid they ask for a monthly statement!",0
"March 2025  We just change from QuickBooks to Xero and this simple feature is so important to our operation we are considering switching back. Wero is not vey user friendly and more expensive than QuickBooks, but the problems we had with QB we can probably live with. Please add this simple feature and look after you clients. QuicBooks can do it, it can't be that hard.",0
Glad to see this is finally being addressed. The ability to select a different address on the invoice screen helps our workflow.,3
This would be great,2

Dear Briana,

Thank you for your reply the format of which suggests that it is an edited cut and paste ""stock"" reply which has been used many times in response to several client complaints.
I am aware of the ""Xero Product Idea"" within Xero Central - indeed if you read the comments that go back several years, you will see that I have contributed many times. Unfortunately, despite Kelly Munro's assurances on March 6th 2023 that the team were ""working on it"" (see excerpt of her reply below) nothing has been heard from her in the intervening 12 months and a solution has still not been achieved for the (nearly 1000) clients who have voted for it.
---8<---
Kelly Munro - "" Multiple addresses has been enabled in the back end of contacts. As mentioned in our previous update this is a complex piece of work, as we need to now build this into other areas of Xero where it'll add value.

For this reason the work within Contacts is not live yet, as without building this feature across these other areas it wouldn't have much practical use. But to confirm, work's moving along and we look forward to being able to share more""
---8<---
I do not accept that a company the size of Xero with all of the IT specialists and technicians it employs can't find a way to resolve this quickly if the will to do so exists. The fact that this has been ongoing for so many years indicates that Xero is not taking the issue seriously despite its assurances to the contrary.
I am also aware of the ""work around"" involving setting up a separate account for each different delivery address - this is messy and time consuming. Furthermore, sending multiple statements out to a single entity, which this would necessitate, is impractical, time consuming and annoying for both vendor and purchaser. Analysing client sales / payment data would also be considerably more complex if multiple account files were to be set up in this way.
Similarly, editing the customer account with a new delivery address each time is both messy and time consuming - particularly as it has to be done on a line by line basis (it is not possible to simply cut and paste multiple lines of an address into the available fields).

My request also mentions another issue regarding the transition from Classic to ""New"" Invoicing, which you have not addressed. In Classic, the available stock was shown on the invoice template when entering a figure in the quantity column, however in the New Invoicing system it does not - meaning the operator has to open another ""session"" and view the available stock in ""Business / Products and Services"". Again, this is time consuming and effectively a downgrading of Xero's product. This functionality is still available in ""Quotes"" and indeed shows when raising a ""Credit Note"" within the Invoicing tab, so the coding obviously exists, leading me to think that Xero has deliberately turned the function off within Invoicing for some reason. Again, this is a popular topic on the ""Product Ideas"" page of Xero Central that has not been addressed by anyone at Xero since I first wrote about it in August 2022!
https://productideas.xero.com/forums/939198-for-small-businesses/suggestions/45529378-new-invoicing-show-stock-level-when-adding-a-tra

So, I remain highly unsatisfied and frustrated with the lack of progress and poor communication from Xero. I get the feeling that, on the rare occasions that Xero do reply, the aim of the reply is to stall, obfuscate and placate, with no intention to actually address the issues raised. My position therefore remains, that if at the end of my financial year Xero has not addresses these issues and provided solutions, I will be looking to change to another platform where the aforementioned functionality already exists and you will lose my business. In the meantime, I will also continue to use X (Twitter) to keep others aware of the lack of progress and the disregard that Xero has for its existing customers. As a courtesy to other Xero clients I will also be copying this thread to the Xero central.

I look forward to receiving your further and more positive feedback in due course.

Sincerely,

Graham Tottle",0
"I too agree with Kim, William and Graham.  Xero seem to be very good at implementing changes that have a negative impact  but might in their opinion make it look prettier and have more white space but all these changes are not adding function and value and the ideas posted here that are so heavily positively supported are continually ignored.  The last update on this from Kelly was in March 2023 so five months on this is still outstanding.  We too have stopped recommending Xero and are actively looking for an alternative.",0
Thank goodness! No more manual typing on packing slips. You are a life saver.,4
"Well just over a month to go before they supposably close of Classic Invoicing and force all users to use an inferior user interface.

Have they listened to any users? Nope, still have not got New to anywhere near like the functionality and efficient layout of the Classic - actually the name sames its Classic -  judged over a period of time to be of the highest quality and outstanding of its kind.

Now on their, Xero, web site they say: We’re with you every step of the way
Our new and improved invoicing has been designed to bring you more flexibility and customization options – and help you get paid on time. We’re committed to evolving every product we offer, to create the best experience for our customers now, and into the future.

That is a lot of political cover up in my opinion and based on continual comments coming through I think a lot of users will agree.

They even go further and say: As always, your feedback is essential, so please share your thoughts on Xero Product Ideas. Your input ensures new invoicing can continue to meet and we hope, exceed your expectations as we evolve it. Please check out Xero Central for the latest updates and helpful resources. 

Have they (Xero) listened to users feedback - don't think so, still same old issues keep coming through on feedback including no proper history tracking, payment detail at top of invoice (Xero keep pushing for getting users to use their payment system - get paid quicker - will I don't want to so stop trying to push something onto me - its like spam in my opinion - would like to push this to the Commerce Commission - might be an idea.)

Anyway - I will stick with Classic until it dies - but must say Xero, users are not happy and I don't see how your shareholders can be - given you haven't paid them a dividend yet - as far as i know - and will this push to New drop the share price - it would in my opinion.

Ok, back to work on Classic invoice for a new sale - quick and easy in Classic horrible and time consuming in New :(.",0
Seems that this really is a priority for many Xero users now. Any update?,2
This is a massive improvement. It makes Xero the best option on the market again.,4
"I cannot believe this feature is still not live!  We got suckered in by the marketing claims from Xero and our so called advisor, and are actively looking to change.  Xero does not care about implementing multiple contacts, as long as people are still paying!!",0
"This would be a very helpful feature.   It seems an obvious thing to enable a bank rule to populate the description field from the bank feed.    

Bank feeds tend to be very standard in content and layout.

The reference field can be programmed in this way.  Please can you add this feature to the description box?",2
"This feature would be a great addition to Xero and a feature that everyone seems to be crying for!!

We have looked at Paidnice and while that would solve our concern, we cannot warrant the monthly fee as we do not invoice that frequently being a smaller business. 

Our Xero subscriptions goes up constantly, yet no new features to prove its worth! 

Please Xero, can we have this feature added. Surely you can see it’s a feature worthwhile - it’s been requested for 12 years!!!",1

To be fair, they have replied - but as you can see from the text below, I am not altogether happy with their response...

Contacts - Allow multiple addresses for a single contact record.
Invoicing - show available stock (as on quotations)
There has been no response from Zero regarding the above topic since Kelly Munro's reply of March 6th 2023 despite over 1000 (Xero) clients voting and stating they are serious issues for them. I have posted to Xero Central many times and written to your CEO Sukhinda, only to be either ignored, or referred back to Xero Central. This is not good enough. Not only is there no progress, but there is no feedback from Xero who seem to be holding their clients in complete contempt. Even after posting to X (Twitter) your colleagues referred me back to Xero Central - which is like going round and round in circles. At the end of my financial year, I will be switching to another provider - I am sick and tired of being ignored.

Hi Graham


Thank you for inviting Xero Support into your organisation.


It sounds like you want to enter multiple delivery addresses for a single contact record in Xero. If that's correct, this isn't currently possible in Xero but we've noted your interest in this feature and passed the feedback to our Product Team for inclusion in their regular reviews.


The Product Team is already looking into developing that functionality for the future and there's an existing Xero Product Idea for this feature where you can vote and comment on the request. I've included the link below. When there are any new developments or releases for this feature, we'll post an update on that page to let our users know.


In the meantime, one option would be to create a separate contact record in Xero for each delivery address. However, please note that every contact in Xero must have a unique name, so you'd need to enter a different name for each contact record. This can be as little as added a period or number to the name.


Alternatively, you could update the delivery address on each invoice as needed. With that method, the new address will automatically be saved to the contact record and update the details there as well.


I've included links to support articles with more information.

Lack of Xero 2 xero is the only reason I haven't switched to new invoicing. Disappointing I'll lose access to it next week,1
The years are rolling by and not only has it not been done.  There is also no response.  I’m looking to leave on this.  Plus the increases in costs and forced backwards functionality.,0
"I switched from Sage to Xero because I find Xero more straightforward and user-friendly. However, Sage offers more features, like the ability to assign multiple shipping addresses to a single contact. This is important for me because I have clients with multiple branches, and my driver often gets confused about the correct delivery address. I currently have to handwrite the address on the delivery slip, which is time-consuming.",3
"Michelle - potential work around (not ideal but might save you time).  Make up a draft invoice (or draft quote) that can be easily copied to create a new invoice.  In this draft, make up your 42 lines but adding just 1 dot in the description field in each line.   Keep this draft as your template.  When it's time to make up an invoice, copy the template to create a new invoice - you can then paste in repeatedly into the lines you want  to overwrite the dot you originally put in.     If you're able to use a Produce or Service as your standard lines you put in repeatedly, even better.",2
"Really helpful to have a customer field for how to present an invoice. 
Many of our customers use various supplier portals (each with their own url and login details etc) others require invoices to be sent to a specific email address.  It would be very helpful to have a free text field in the Customer attribute to allow us to record how invoices should be presented to the specific customer.  The field should be large enough to support a URL, username and password and some free text if necessary.",2
"Completely agree with Kim and William on this one - the deafening silence from Xero is shocking. I note that after a few adverse comments on another issue (Show contacts on one page) the thread was ""closed"" recently - Xero said contributors were going off topic.... so I suspect the same will happen to this one shortly too. The new CEO (Sukhinder Singh Cassidy) promised more openness but when I wrote to her, I received a message back from her ""team"" (the people I was complaining about) repeating the same old platitudes, before presumably sending my comments to the recycling bin.
This feature (multiple delivery addresses) already exists as a feature on the Purchase Order screen, so it can't be difficult to implement, I am therefore left with no other option but to conclude that Xero don't want to do it for some reason and are not being honest in their (2) replies? Perhaps they are looking at a ""cost v benefit"" analysis that tells them they won't lose too many clients by not doing anything so it won't affect their bottom line too much - or am I being too cynical? Either way, I won't be recommending Xero to anyone until the situation changes for the better and as soon as practical will be moving to another platform with better customer service.
Sukhinder needs to get across this - I don't think they realise how angry their clients are about being fobbed off, patronised and ignored in this way.",0
Huge relief to have this sorted. Invoicing is actually fast again. 10/10 update.,4
"@Nicole Neale ... spot on!! I'm new to this thread, but have been on a few other threads for YEARS!!!

And here we are, another fairly standard function that Xero doesn't provide, and clearly has no intention of providing. Meanwhile, they have a fancy new invoicing system that offers a whole bunch of **** that no one asked for!

I'd say Do Better Xero, but why would I bother?!",0
VERY IMPORTANT,1
"Each ABN is a separate legal entity so can only belong to one Xero file. 
Both the ABN and legal entity type (eg sole trader, partnership, company) belong exclusively to each other and should be represented by separate Xero files and once set up not be allowed to change to prevent client disaster.",2
"Hi Kelly

When CLASSIC was RETIRED it wasn't blown to smithereens — was it?
It's still there — isn't it?
It's just turned off — correct?
Surely it wouldn't take very much to ""flick the switch"" and turn CLASSIC back on — correct?
And this must be a hot topic of discussion at management level within Xero — correct?

We get that some people will feel like they have egg on their faces if they admit NEW Invoicing has been a monumental fail — they just need to keep their egos in check

No-one cares that they gave it a red hot go and it didn't work, good on them for having a go — but don't keep flogging this dead horse (NEW) — be brave, pull the pin, turn CLASSIC back on — and be our hero ... CAPTAIN CLASSIC

Otherwise — could you please have this proposal put in front of Xero Management ... Xero customers wanting to use CLASSIC pay an additional amount per month — I don't know, 50 bucks or something — because currently the nightmare of using NEW is costing me more than $600 a year — plus the extra stress is just a heart attack waiting to happen 

Please ask them to be one of the first technology companies to admit they got it wrong, to listen to their customers and to provide the software solution their very loyal customers have supported for many years 

Or offer both — CLASSIC and NEW — charge a premium for CLASSIC, I don't care how its done ... I just need CLASSIC back and I'm not alone 

VOTE 1 FOR CAPTAIN CLASSIC ... making the boring lives of us CFOs / Financial Controllers / Finance Directors / Finance Managers / Finance Department Team Members just that little bit brighter with every saved keystroke ... ""To Infinity and Beyond” 

Cheers

"A Unit of measure of mm is crucial. And I am pretty sure I know how Xero can cater to the needs of any unit.

You've gotta ask how you measure a unit at the start and for stocktake.

When I get units in, it is in mm, so when it starts, I change a setting from Units of Unit to mm increments, from there I say how many mm I acquire and then between here and stocktake, this is the data that is required for reporting purposes.

When assessing how to track this, ideally you need to know how to accommodate it, and when you know the item and you know the unit, you can see ""Units sold"" and it's 50 units is equal to 50mm based on the Original setting for that item versus say a physical item of a filter which 50 units would be a Unit qty of 50 of these.

Either way, it's 50 and 50, 50 qty of either, but 50 in a different metric of units from Unit to metric milimetres.

I support this feature and unfortunately this will be the achilies heel for my business operations which run on exactly the metric measurement which is difficult to implement without paying $200.00 per month which would wipe out all profits unfortunately.

Doing things harder at this point is working smarter.",1

"Again I like to voice my frustration about Xero's present ""simple"" address management. We just prepared a quote to a client and client requested on the quote the address to be for branch B. So we had to change the client's address to address B and then issue the quote. 

What I did not expect is that this procedure also changes the address on all former and accepted quotes to this client. Quotes are important contractual and legal document forming part of the purchase contract and once a quote is accepted it should never change. At least not unintentionally.",0

"many of our customers are large organizations (like universities). While all the bills for invoices to different departments are paid by the university, we invoice the individual departments separately, and they all have separate contact information (emails, phone, mailing addresses). 

In Quickbooks, we used ""Jobs"" (which are basically folders inside the customer), for each department. Each Job could have its own contact info. Something like that would be welcome. As it is now, we have to have 22 separate customers just for one university, because that's how many departments we work with. Even though the checks for all of those come from the same place. ",2
Thanks so much :-),4

"Greg, I totally agree with you. Regretting moving from Reckon Desktop. Xero has created twice as much work for me, without the basic functionality that even Open Source packages have. We have one customer that may have 100 different site addresses in one year, and Xero is creating a nightmare.",0
"Hi Kelly,

After reading the below comments I'm not holding out much hope of my issue being resolved any time soon.  However, will leave my thoughts here for you.
Our business deals with Real Estate agents and as you would expect, Real Estates have hundreds of properties on their books that we need to assist with.  It's vital that we can have a single contact on our records but with multiple delivery addresses.  Please tell me it's not going to take another 10 years for this issue to be fixed?",0
"Because I can't create an invoice that calculates quantity, price, and number of months (custom field), I have to create invoices manually for some services.

"Been reviewing the Easy Business App. 20% of the price of Xero. Sydney based support team.  

I can't believe they kicked this new invoicing off or, more importantly, stopped Classic Invoicing. Might be time to sign up for an Easy Business App Demo.

I would have had Classic Invoicing as the basic package (we all know it works) and then the new features (which are unnecessary or helpful) as options we can turn on. 

For the most Classic Invoicing worked, new invoicing doesn't over so many varied industries and uses based on all the responses on here over the passed few months.

Why send a survey two days ago? That is taking the PI55.

"Incredible... it's taking more than 12 years to implement such a fundamental and basic function?!

The complete absence of communication regarding the status of this request is simply unacceptable. 

Customers have been left in the dark, unsure whether their concerns are even being considered, let alone addressed. This lack of transparency breeds frustration and erodes trust in your brand.

It is evident that Xero's priorities are misplaced, focusing more on acquiring new customers rather than prioritising the needs and concerns of existing ones.
 
Customers who have invested time and resources into your platform expect better treatment and... respect!",0
This is a must release feature in my opinion,1
"Hi Kelly, 

We're a certified app partner and I must say this is the most commonly asked questions by our users who have integrated our app with Xero. Like myself they cannot believe that this functionality doesn't exist at all on Xero. A lot of service industries rely on date entries for easy viewing on the invoice. It seems a no brainer to me in terms of functionality that should compliment products and services. I'm sure you could make it configurable as an option, and would be a great improvement to the new invoicing.   

Couple of days of dev work would save you a lot of customers going to Quickbooks",1
Good to see this on the roadmap. It will be helpful for our construction clients who move sites frequently.,3
"Why does XERO autofill the ""payment date"" to some weird date? Eg: I'm paying wages today (4 June 2024) and Xero autofills the payment date to 18 May 2024. If I didn't pick on this then IRD would fine us $250 for late filing and payment (trust me I've been burnt twice on this very issue). Xero should not autofill the payment date but leave it blank for us to fill in.",1
The '.' still does not seem to work in the invoice date field?  The '/' works fine.,2
"Another month-end with more incorrect VAT rates on invoices going out to clients - this is so frustrating and not something that we had problems with previously!

Please can you review this request again - what is the point in setting defaults in contacts, when they only work on new invoices? Copying prior invoices is so important when you have repeating business, we use this every time we raise an invoice and for it to not be using the defaults as set against the contact is causing so many issues - VAT being the major one!",1

"Omg Xero, why don't you understand requests properly???! 😂

Previously:
You want the option to print PAYGI? Too bad, you didn't change it on the estimates page from No to Yes. So you can't print it unless you unlock the return.

Xero:
We've not only given you the option to print PAYG Instalments - we're forcing you to 🙄

Leave it available in the print settings but default it to No! We don't want to print it every time, we just want to be able to print it sometimes and not need to unlock the return to do so! Seriously...

Why does Xero make changes that affect everyone on requests with only 38 votes..?",1
This update is gold. Thank you for finally making this happen Xero! Highly appreciated.,4
"YES! We so need to do this. Xero contacts is fine when your client is an individual with two residential addresses but when your main client is a corporate and your dealing with various staff or departments, there are very limited fields to use. I've just tried to add the details (mobile, email and title) of an accounts person at a building company that we work with, and 1) I can't enter all these fields ""Their Title"", and 2), I already have 5 contacts under the client and can't add any more. This happens all the time, and we are a small business. ",2

But Quackbooks is terrible in all other respects, so I would rather stick with not being able to reconcile properly in Xero :)

Come on Xero - you tick the boxes in so many ways but this function is a standard requirement for all business - not just those who take the time to contact you about it.,1
Make new invoicing fit on one screen - currently classic fits on one screen and is easy to use. Reduce the need to scroll and zoom/unzoom to have a consistent sizing approach across all invoicing/billing/reporting,2
"I totally agree with Joana. It appears that I will have to move to Xero Ultimate just to run a payroll for 6 people? I don't need a lot of the other added features, just a basic package with the ability to add more people to the payroll.",1
Being able to create your own field in contacts would be great!  We pay a lot of our vendors by Zelle and would like to keep their email or phone # that is connected to their zelle account which maybe different than their business email or phone #.  Or just have a general Notes section so we can input notes we would like to see when looking at vendor.,3

"As a compnay we supply services to property managers but they need the invoice to go directly to their landlords, to have to create multiple contacts for all the individual properties for the same client would be really complicated and would mean we don't have a proper history for the client as all invoices would be spread across multiple contacts.",2
"It has actually been over 10 years since this feature was requested. No update as to when this could be added and suggests that no development has been done in Bills for a long time as it could easily be incorporated into an update. It is standard practice for Purchase Order reference to be linked to a bill, but Xero expects this to be added into the line detail. This is a very backward approach for a forward thinking company. It may seem trivial, but if you are dealing with this for hundreds of bills a week/month, the benefits of Xero start to get outweighed by the daily functionality of other options.",1
"Hi there, please make this available in WorkFlow Max also.
Also an address book function so you do not have to add the same contacts manually against different clients.",2
"Hi Kelly, 
Please confirm when we can expect this important update on a single contact with multiple delivery addresses. This is a a basic and having to enter the address manually defeats the objective of the automation and time saving aspect xero promotes. ",2

12 years isn't that long! Can't you see this vital change has been logged as ""in development""? That means they're working on it and we shall just have to wait a little longer, fingers crossed before we're all retired.",1
Love this update! Saved me hours of data entry this week alone. Brilliant work.,4
"Another WCAG fail, and a UI fail in general, is that timing matters a whole lot. For example, on the ""new"" (******) invoice UI, tab into the ""item"" field and type (for example) ""tes"" and press tab. 

If you have an item with the name ""test"" , one of two things will happen;
- the item ""test"" will be selected and fill in the invoice line.
- the item ""test"" will not be found, and you will open the ""add item"" popup window. 

The determining factor for which behaviour happens is unknown to the UI team. They cannot seem to understand, or care, or be allowed to care, that non-deterministic behaviour in a UI makes the UI absolutely useless. Invoicing is a critical module, possibly the most important module in the system, and they failed so badly.",0
"It is essential for us to be able to spread the cost of an annual bill thoughout the year.
We receive many invoices annually / quarterly and this would save a lot of time.",2
"NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

This function is CRITICAL if we are to get VALUE out of XERO.  We have Customers that need additional information, which can't be replicated in XERO from CIN7 due to XERO not having the option of ADDITIONAL FIELDS.
If we could, we would be able to MAXIMISE the function of AUTO REMINDERS for certain Customers.  Our staff waste time resending unpaid invoices.  
This function SHOULD ALREADY be in XERO.  Other accounting software have it.

Also you said that there was not likely to be any action for the next 12 months.  That was back in March 2023.  So it's now 2 years later.

Have XERO put this on the agenda yet?

If not, who do I need to talk to explain how important this function is.  As a share holder, it ****** me off that XERO is not listening to their Customers (even though Xero is making money for me).  To continue to focus on making money is a rather short sighted strategy as once you have Customers leave they will not come back.

"@Accounts - I moved one of my small sole traders to Reckon as she was on Xero starter and it was an issue with being able to enter bills after 5 were received. She didn't invoice from Xero so it was not worth moving her to the Standard/Grow Plan just to get more bill entry. I moved her over to the Reckon one for that reason plus we got a 6 mth discount so it was NZ$10.00 month incl GST but gave us basically what the Xero Standard Plan gave. It's now NZ$22 incl GST but still better than Xero's starter plan.

"This is a great Idea, but we should be able to accept the first deposit via the Quote / Estime once its approved (enable a signature via web or mobile once accepted) then create invoies based on the down payment amounts and put on waiting approval to be sent to the client once contract step is completed.",2
"I don't use shortcut keys so no use to me. I tried the new invoicing layout and still hate it, still too much white space - should be nice and compact like classic, and still too many clicks to do anything. 

I checked the history for this one invoice and instead of 3 - 4 lines for the initial invoice in history I have 11 lines just to do one invoice. Every box clicked is reported as edited - don't need all that extra, I don't need to know I edited the reference change from to, or the due date changed unless I actually change the date at some point, how many lines are we going to end up if we have to go back in and edit something again later on.
This should be exactly the same as in classic, what a pain if I ever have to use this in future to prove who an invoice was sent to as they don't need to see all that as I PDF the history.

Seriously you have taken Xero backwards and still overlooking what people are actually saying and going ahead with things that add additional time to busy workloads already.

"This is an example of a platform development/services company that, up until recently, had the same issue as Xero does with regards to a lack of updates on most requested features like this one.

Seriously, I've reached a juncture that - without this feature - I'm going to need to migrate to a different platform.

An update, even if progress has been slow, is better than the radio silence we're been subjected to. And the great part? It'd be super easy to make happen with how engaged you are on your Twitter profile, and doesn't need massive capital or a budget to make happen.

You could say it'd cost you $0.00 to, ultimately, do right on your user base.

"Thank you Xero! This worked today!!!! What a relief to have this feature back. Now that item codes are pulled in for billable expenses, the new invoicing actually represents an improvement for my purposes. Thank you for addressing this request.",4
"This was idea was submitted 2012.

THIRTEEN YEARS AGO.

As a programmer, I understand why this has not been implemented, as it's extremely difficult to change the format of the line in the table (especially with custom .docx files) to have either a full line that stretches across the table (merging all the cells) or a standard line with all the individual details.

So here's an idea.

1. The advanced templates will have two table rows in the items loop:
  1.1 The first defines the table row design of a comment
  1.2 The second defines the table row design of an itemised line

2. The PDF creator will choose to use:
  2.1 The comment line format if the item quantity is empty or has a value of 0 (zero)
  2.2 The itemised line format if it's not zero.

I don't even want to be paid for this idea.
But I know it's doable and not too hard to implement, if you've written your code well.

So, get it done and see the kudos flow in.",1
"Good morning XERO,

Could we have an ETA for this request. It appears to be a feature that has been asked for years.

In resume: Providing us with the capacity of entering multiple addresses per ORG with also the possibility to put 1 person responsible per addresses.

This use case is a reality with many businesses.

We really need this feature.

Thank you for

"Implementing an early settlement discount feature would be a significant improvement for our company. Most of our suppliers offer these discounts, so the ability to post a discount with each invoice—subject to a specific payment date—would be ideal.

Specifically, we are looking for a system that automatically applies the discount to invoices paid within the qualifying window during bulk payments, while defaulting to the full invoice amount for those that fall outside that timeframe.

This functionality would greatly enhance our efficiency. Could you please let me know if this is something that can be supported?",2

"How is Xero so far behind here?  I can't enter a PO number, a delivery address, an ""attention to"" name unique to each invoice.  It seems like such a simple thing to do and I was surprised I couldn't find it anywhere.  Thought I was going crazy.

Not only can Xero not do it, but it appears they have no intention on getting it up and running.  ""New Invoicing"" Pffft!  What a waste of time.

I know which software I will be referring clients back to.  At least then they can do what they need and I don't have to listen to all the complaints.",0

Interesting Ethos for support.


The reason we don't make our Development Plan public is so that we can retain flexibility regarding features included in releases. We do mention some planned features on our blog, but as others are more susceptible to change, we'd rather under-promise and over-deliver than vice versa.

This basic function has been available with Quickbooks Online for over 12 years. I personally regret switching to XERO at the suggestion of my accountant. XERO is clearly tailored to meet the needs of accountants and is completely out-of-touch with the needs of it's end-users. I'm so sick of this ****. I want to go back to Quickbooks.",0

One thing I have noticed however and gives room for further improvement is that not all clients run stock adjustments through a single account code.

Regardless this is a great step forward and a timesaver.",4
Being forced away from Quickbooks Desktop but just found out Xero doesn't support multiple site addresses. This is essential for many businesses particularly those in the service industry. Quickbooks Online supports this!,2
"I agree with most of the comments on this thread - Xero clearly have no intention of keeping their customers updated or making the requested changes. In addition to the request for multiple delivery addresses, I have also been contributing to the thread on showing available stock levels in the quantity field when typing an invoice (as per the Classic system, the quotation and billing screens) Again, a deafening silence from Xero (as the coding already exists and is working in other templates, why is it so difficult to implement in Invoicing?)
Anyway, my head is hurting from ******* it against these particular brick walls (I even tried writing to the new CEO but she couldn't be bothered to reply either) so I think a change of tack is required. I have had a great deal of success recently in embarrassing large companies on X (formerly Twitter) so from now I think a regular (lack of) progress report on the Xero Twitter page will be forthcoming - perhaps it will save any potential new Xero customers from being disappointed..... if anyone cares to contribute their Twitter (I will always call it Twitter as I think the X title is just daft) handle is  @Xero",0

Instead of fixing this issue, you have changed the way that you update client details.  Instead of amending client postal address, physical address and phone number etc on the one screen, lets put in a process that takes three times as long as you have to go into three different screens to update this information.

Why do your programmers insist on creating more problems instead of fixing that ones that we have been asking for for over 10 years......

New invoicing is hideously inefficient and the automatic allocation of an invoice number that is locked in even at draft stage is an accounting nightmare.

"I think xero is overthinking this.  The way it works in quickbooks and others is you can freeform paste in a shipping address during invoice creating.  Since our clients jobs (contruction) go from address to address, it is not important to keep this info in a record beyond just the invoice.

Let me repeat: we have customers where the shipping invoice is NEVER the same and it changes EVERY bill.

What most people are doing now in xero is adding it to the reference field or pasting in a ""freight"" item line.  So why not just have an optionally-filled ship to line that can be pasted into as customers are already doing with these workarounds??",0

"One more thought ... 
There is another company, Microsoft, who had (arguably) a great software product at one point, but destroyed that potential because (in part) they employed the ideas of ""change for the sake of change"" and ""any change must be for the benefit of the shareholders, not the users"". 
If you look at a modern Microsoft product, its mostly advertising, no real progress on key features, and many many features lost including stability and security. Anti-malware is almost unheard of in Mac and Linux, but mandatory for windows. UI speed is worse despite the fastest chips in history and huge amounts of available RAM, and local search is slower then ever, with ""progress"" bars that don't actually mean anything. This is where Xero is heading.

Do you remember Microsoft tried to get rid of the start menu? They claimed that their telemetry showed that ""few people used the start menu""
In Invoicing, its not rocket science to understand that most users will create an invoice and email it. In ""New"" invoicing, emailing that invoice has been pushed from a dedicated button, to a link hidden in a submenu. This is Xero's ""get rid of the start menu"" moment, and shows how dedicated they are to enshitifying the product.
Microsoft's drive was to remove the start menu so that a full page ""app picker"" would be the standard way to start apps - because then, you have the real estate to show ads. That's what it was all about - enshitifying the experience , making it much worse for users, in return for a few cents of advertising revenue for shareholders of microsoft.",1
"Just adding to the growing frustration here — it's really unacceptable that Xero still doesn't support WET as a standard feature. This isn’t a niche requirement — it’s a legal obligation for businesses in the wine industry, and we shouldn’t have to rely on clunky workarounds or third-party tools to stay compliant.

MYOB has had WET functionality built-in for years, so it's baffling that Xero hasn’t addressed this yet. For a platform that promotes itself as being modern and user-friendly, ignoring something as fundamental as WET doesn’t reflect well.

This needs to be prioritised. It’s not just an inconvenience — it’s a serious limitation for any wine business using Xero.",1
"Building on this request, it would also be extremely helpful to have the ability to choose which linked person under a single business contact is used when creating quotes or invoices. Many businesses work with multiple individuals at the same company, and being able to select the correct person (rather than defaulting to the primary contact) would greatly improve accuracy and tracking.",4
Dear Xero. You may or may not be aware that Quickbooks Desktop is being discontinued on 30th June this year. Not having a different delivery address or multiple address options will be a deal breaker for many and they will choose other software over Xero.,1

"I received this reply:

""Idea: Payment screen in New Invoicing
 
Hi all, in new invoicing you should be able to Tab to any of the fields on the page including the Add Payment button. Alternatively, using the shortcut Ctrl-Alt-Y will open the payments modal.

Once this opens it'll default to the Amount Paid field, and you can Tab across to the Date field. Pressing Enter, space bar, or the down arrow will open the calendar picker, and you can Tab, then use the arrow keys to select the date you want.

If you're not getting this same behaviour we'd recommend raising a case with our Xero Support team through Xero Central where we can get a closer look with you 1:1.""

It's too bad that the Product Team doesn't know how the product actually works.  I j just tried this again and in the ""Add Payment"" window, you can only tab between the Amount Paid field and the Reference field.  You cannot tab to the Date field or the Account field.  It requires a mouse click.",1
"For large organisations that we invoice:
We often need to send invoices and statements to multiple contacts within the same organisation, especially when different departments are responsible for different projects.

Each contact should only receive reminders and statements relevant to their department or project—NOT for the whole organisation.

The current Xero invoicing system treats all contacts under the same organisation name as a single account. As a workaround, we have been slightly altering the organisation name to differentiate them, for example:

Company Pty Ltd
Company Pty. Ltd.
Company. Pty. Ltd.

This has allowed us to send specific invoices and statements to each contact, but when you are dealing with more than 5 contacts in an organisation it becomes a nightmare to manage. 

Please consider this also when implementing these improvements.",2

"My Thoughts

Reason for Feature Development
1. Professional Presentation for Clients

Many businesses want to present clean, summary-style invoices to clients without exposing detailed internal breakdowns (e.g., markup, subcontractor fees, individual material costs).
Currently, to avoid showing certain line items, businesses must manually merge or delete them, which complicates record keeping and audit trails.
2. Maintain Accurate Internal Reporting

Businesses often use detailed line items for internal analysis, job costing, and tracking. Hiding items from the client-facing invoice while retaining them in the backend would preserve data integrity without compromising client presentation.
3. Competitive Sensitivity

In trades, consulting, and contracting industries, line items may reveal sensitive supplier costs, margins, or proprietary service breakdowns. Hiding them prevents price shopping and protects intellectual property.
4. Industry Standards

Competitor software (e.g., QuickBooks, FreshBooks, and Zoho Books) offer “summary invoices,” “collapsible line items,” or “internal notes only.” To stay competitive, Xero should match this flexibility.
5. Enhanced Customisation and Control

Businesses increasingly demand invoice customisation. Adding this feature would improve user satisfaction, especially among trades, agencies, and firms who need tailored client communication.",1
"How do I remove my name, and more specifically my email, from this idea? I have gotten every update for a few years now.

Too little too late for me Xero. The last price rise was the last straw for me - 80% increase over 3 years.

Staff Access to Xero Clients- I have more than 200 clients. I am struggling assigning the clients to my Team using new method especially when new team member join and i need to allocate 50 clients to him.

Also In new way client are in random order and there is no way sorting them in assending or desending order.,2

If you could enter the date instead of having to tab and arrow etc it would be significantly fewer keypresses, even without the focus order failure.",1

"we have noticed the recent change in Conacts to allow Deliery addresses as well as billing addresses...great start...but unworkable as the delivey address becomes part of the Invoice address...just with the Itlaicises ATTENTION and the details..
Why cannot we just select the Billing Address or the seperate Delivery addresses   as some of our customers have delivery to different addresses.",1
@Anya Pagden using a non tracking product will make the shipping address show up on the invoice and packing slip and as it's not tracking it wont affect your inventory. All you need to do is use a logical number system for the part number. e.g. DEL-XYZL01-001. The 2nd and 3 part of the part number relate to the customer account reference and address sequence. if you have 10 delivery addresses it would go all the way upto 010.,2
Why even have a 'Delivery Address' field if it can't be unique to an invoice? It's just stupid beyond belief!,1
i eagerly await this feature to be developed. It will really save so much time. thanks,2

"Issues relating to credit notes.  

When allocating supplier payments we currently have to allocate credit notes first in the 'pay bills' section before being able to allocate the bank payment to the balance.  This causes issues with the remittance advice that is then sent to the supplier because the credit note is not show separately.  

It also means we have to review aged payables for credit notes before we can allocate bank payments in the bank payment screen.  It would be more helpful if the credit note appeared in the match screen in the bank section and could be included along with the invoices.

It would also be helpful if you could allocate a supplier/customer refund from the bank screen to the relevant credit note.",2

"Hi Kelly,

The comments below are not directed at you personally, just Xero & are borne from extreme frustration.

Thank you for the update, but talk about getting the cart before the horse, wouldn't the survey BEFORE you started changing everything been a better idea!!!!

You've not mentioned extending the availability of Classic, so can only assume that New Invoicing is going to be forced on us on the 27th in the hope that we will get used to it & stop complaining.  Never going to happen!!

It's not like we are asking for the moon or anything, we just want the functionality & efficiency we currently have with Classic.

What I don't understand is that you could totally revamp the suppliers module (to make it the nightmare it is) without having to change the input screen, so why is this different??

Or is changing that the next little surprise you have instore for us??

Your telling us that Xero is listening, but I'm yet to see any evidence of that.

I used to love your product, now I am starting to hate it & if things continue down the same path as they have with all the changes over the last 12 months, I think I will be moving on & taking my 29 clients with me.",0
Much appreciated update. It makes the statement run much cleaner now that we don't have split accounts.,3

Also if the credit notes are listed on the batch payment print out it would be easier to match invoices paid, credits claimed for the file clerk - ie each invoice/credit note would be listed on the pay stub",2

Xero should allow for a contact export where you can have a column with the unique ID of each contact. That is quite helpful if you need to run a reconciliation with other systems.,2

"Hi Kelly,
Capital and Tax Losses brought forward.
All types of returns.
P.s. why would you rollover the Losses Schedule from the prior year into a Losses Worksheet this year? Why not roll it into a Losses Schedule? The way Xero works with Losses/Schedule/Worksheets is so silly. E.g. if I have a small amount of carried forward capital losses in a trust return, it will carry over the losses as brought forward losses to the current year return, I can even edit this, but if there is a small capital gain in the year and some losses recouped, I can't adjust the carried forward losses without creating a losses schedule or worksheet (even though the ATO tax return instructions say I don't have to add a losses schedule or worksheet to the return!).",1

"Heartily agree with all the comments about the appalling lack of action and response from Xero on this issue.  Changed to Xero this year believing we were moving to an innovative company with great customer service.

Unfortunately I can now see that's not the case, and would definitely not recommend Xero to anyone, the customer service is worse than the company we came from and that's saying a lot!!!

It's such a drama to do basic tasks that are readily avail in other systems and constantly feel unprofessional in having to do things in ad hoc ways just to get what we need from the system.

If anyone discovers a good alternative please let us all know!!!",0

And the information on invoice A shouldn't be changing every time someone has to change the shipping address for a different invoice to the same billing address!  OMG.  So I have to go back and change the information AGAIN just to resend a copy of the A invoice because the customer lost it. And I am not even in accounting!

New Invoicing -Option to Add Multiple New Lines at once (5, 10, 15 or 20)

When using Classic version of invoicing, there was an option to Add a new line and then a drop down option to Add 5, Add 10, Add 20 lines.

In the New version of invoicing, this option seems to have disappeared?

Please provide this option if this has not already been provided. I can only seem to add a new line after entering the first line of information.

I found the Add 5 and Add 10 lines really helpful when I'm copying similar job items down a list than having to tab across to get to the next line when I was preparing sales invoices.

"Yeah kind of wild this isn't in XERO already?

I mean surely this is like 2 days to code max?
I've coded a similar thing to an in-house invoicing system in like 5 hours solo.",2
"Totally agree with Supun - Xero should easily be able to cope with a batch of more than 200 bills.  It is basic.  Although I have noticed a lot of basic features missing on Xero, like selecting date ranges on some layouts, only available by paying for add ons.  If Xero keeps restricting basic features to 'optional extras' then it'll become useless for us.",1
Consolidation reporting for a group entities is needed.,2
"This is a show-stopper for me, previous invoicing software I've used, many different pieces of software, have always had dates for line items - it's virtually essential on monthly/periodic billing for service industries, as the date delivered is a key piece of information.  Including it in the description is completely inappropriate and breaks searchability, as it needs to be accessible via the API or exports as an absolutely key data field of the invoice line.  No Xero for my organisation until this is added.",1
just want confirmation that they have been sent,2
Thanks for the heads up. This saves us from having to use the reference field for street addresses.,3
I am about to migrate to MYOB because of this and their inventory system is much better. Plus its alot cheaper!! Adios amigos :-),0
"It's insane that this request started in 2012!


Reached out for a advice on dealing with interest and fees earned after a invoice has begun being paid (multiple payments) But support have zero interest in helping find workarounds for their systems and offer no actual ideas on the usage of their software. As soon as they have more than one response to a request they resort to the classic 'speak to a tax advisor as this has tax implications' in other words Fu%$ off we don't want to pay for any actual support. and this statement protects us in all situations",0
Absolute joke that this isn't available yet.,0
"@KellyMunro, there are 27 days until you force us to use the new invoicing layout and yet you are still claiming to be updating it to be more like the system that we want.  How crazy is that.  7 years in the making and it's still an abomination.  Classic works so why not allow us to continue with Classic?  You really are not listening to your clients.  All I can say is thank goodness I'm leaving my current employer today and when I start looking for a new job in a couple of months one of the questions I will be asking is what accounting system they use.  If it's Xero I won't even go for an interview, Xero is that bad now - you are just not listening to us.",0
This is exactly what we needed! MYOB didn't even do it this smoothly. Great job.,4
"Surely you have this sorted by now? Will need to move platform if it's not soon.
Can't thin why it's not complete considering other platforms have had it as staple for years.",0
"All these workarounds using various versions of the customer name are fine, but I can see it would be incredibly annoying to have to faff around allocating payments   if the customer makes batch payments. We really need the multiple address update!",2
"Hello,

Coming up 8 months since the last update on where this is headed. I understand a large amount of businesses wouldn't need this feature but for the ones that do, its entirely necessary to run. Even just being able to delete all current items recorded in stock then reuploading a new list of items would be a tremendous amount faster.

Is there any update on this?

Thank you,
Mike",2

"Hi Kelly, please can you give us a rough of idea of how much longer we will have to wait for this? ",2
"I appreciate Xero finally making a statement about this in August. Unfortunately, it isn’t a very strong commitment and feels more like an attempt to ease the pressure around this issue than to actually resolve it.

If we’re still waiting for this feature a year from now, we’ll be moving to another platform that already offers this feature. The workarounds have become too cumbersome, and we simply don’t have the time or capacity to keep managing this issue.",0
"We have been promised this is 'coming' (2 employees/payroll in Grow) but it hasn't happened as yet. I'm sick of  small businesses like ours being ripped off.  I just had to upgrade to Comprehensive for a couple of months, just so I could pay a 2nd worker.  Now we learn Comprehensive is going up in price to $100/month.  It's really too much for a small business like ours that will never have more than a couple of employees.  I guess Xero only really cares about the bigger fish.",1

"They aren't working on this, therefore it will never be implemented. The language in the April 24 community manager response is clear, it's something ""they want to work towards"", not are working on. They ""need to be able to build"", not are building. 

Between April and September they were ""focused on prioritising"" something else, i.e. not this.",1
"Now waiting over 3 years for this update, clients cannot believe that old basic systems had this functionality but Xero platform not even getting close to looking into this matter in UK",0
This is a welcome change. It reduces the risk of our team sending goods to the wrong depot.,3

"@Justine Quarrell 

Thank you for posting your comment about random account numbers. I noticed it as well! I guess it is connected to autosave problem. Autosave interrupts the workflow. For example, if you are typing 458 and after you hit 5 the autosave is saving ""8"" won't be recognised and Xero will input 450 instead. 

I hope the horrible autosave will be optional.",1
"I'm disappointed that this is being put on the back burner as its surely not a big thing to increase the number of bills visible per page. Every other platform offers a ""Show All"" option. The moment you implement that, it will fix the issue with not keeping the ticks in place across multiple pages.

Its extemely frustrating when trying to make Batch Payments for those of us with suppliers who have over 200 bills each month.",1
I agree that we should fill the survey and if after that they still force the new version then there is no hope with Xero.,1
Xero you are bleeding customers due to increased fees. That you aren’t prioritising upgrades that are standard features for your competitors is shocking. Provide a timetable for beta and full deployment schedule for each idea so that we can actually see it working its way through the apps dev pipeline!!!,1

"Its so irritating not being able to manually enter the invoice date and due dates and having to stop and click the actual dates you want. My invoices are 99% backdated and i don't often use the date I'm creating the invoice, so this is very very annoying. I used the old invoicing right up until they took it away, I DO NOT like the new invoicing. Its so much more time consuming and harder to navigate. We should be given the choice to use whichever version of invoicing we prefer. We are the ones paying for it after all!",1
Essential feature delivered! This is why we stay with Xero. Fantastic work.,4
"I've noted that there is a shortcut to the super payment page available in new payruns - once the payrun has been posted, there's some extra buttons, once of which has a dropdown with a link that currently takes you to the super payment page (you still have to do the super run as normal, but if you're doing that with every payrun, it's already halfway to marking this idea as delivered)",3

Fantastic work on this release. It's solved our biggest headache overnight.,4
"It's now September, is there an update on when this will be in place?",2
"An additional complication that not having multiple ship to addresses for each customer causes: if I change the delivery address for a different job site for an existing customer in order to have the invoice be correct, it changes all invoices prior to this one to match the change. So there is no way to track where an item was shipped unless we record it somewhere outside of Xero. Even just the step of keeping invoices intact as they were when created would be helpful!",2
"We have been using Xero for about a year. Between this issue, the inability to send email through our own server to avoid getting tripped up in spam, and the inability to do an ACH payment through Stripe that doesn't involve the customer going to their bank to transfer to us, I've decided we're done. 

The canned responses I get from support feel like a slightly more polished version of what we used to get with Intuit - repetition of what you just said, with no satisfactory answer. And here, almost a year after Kelly posted that they're working on it, this still isn't implemented. I honestly don't think they have any plans to fix any of this stuff. This issue is #2 in the top requests list, for crying out loud. 

We're probably moving to Zoho. Cheaper per month, I've already test-imported all our company data, and they do regular updates and seem really responsive. They also respond (officially) on the Zoho subreddit, and seem to be more together than this mess. Too bad, I actually like Xero - the interface is nice, it's simple, and it mostly just works. But I mean this kind of stuff is a really big deal and they have not demonstrated they care. 

As soon as tax season is over, we're switching to something else. ",1
Thank you for the update Kelly as we are needing this feature for our business. It would be good if the multiple delivery address synced with Workflowmax too.,3

"I don't need to comment further, enough has been said by many others and I have no doubt there are many more who remain silently frustrated with this inept package called Xero.",0
I have looked back and this was first raised 11years ago!! It now has 823 votes! I have to ask what is the point of users asking for the functionality they need if it is going to be ignored? It seems to me that Xero does more tinkering with the look and feel than improving functionality.,1

"I agree and this is the main reason why I have only started using the new invoicing system now as I have no other option.

When I add a billable expense to the invoice it doesn't use the item code so then it never shows that I have sold it in products and services, even though I have.

With the old invoicing I find that I can look back at a bill and see exactly who we sold that product to at a quick glance, now this won't happen.",1
"@Chris Rogers
You're not serious?

FreeAgent has a terrible functionality problem with dealing with Directors Loan Accounts, fixed assets and depreciation and thinks it can calculate Corporation Tax itself, which it can't. It's just not user friendly. It's not simple, it's clunky.

Crapbooks is unusable rubbish that's not fit for purpose.
We have over 75 clients on Xero, 3 remaining on Crapbooks - with many of our clients making the move to Xero in recent years. People are leaving Crapbooks in droves, because it's rubbish. There's no point discussing it further.

Sage Line50 was always the market leader, but when the world moved online, they got left behind and priced themselves out of the market. They have been trying to catch up ever since and Sage Online is not the same product as Sage Line50. They have made improvements in recent years, granted.

Until anything better comes along, Xero is the best value for money - presently - out there.",3

Having multiple shipping addresses in address 'books' for each customer is not an unusual request for any business selling physical products. Not having this facility requires us to enter the shipping address again for a customer with multiple sites whenever they make an new order unless it is to be sent to the site that they last ordered for. There is also potential for order mistakes if we do not change the delivery address. Some of our customers make a batch of duplicate  orders for several sites which is a lot more difficult with the current set up.,2

"Hi Kelly

Please can we have an update on this ESSENTIAL feature.  It doesn't make sense that you say it requires a ""complex solution"", as this is available for purchase orders.  Surely the programmers can just copy the coding across?

"This feature request has been ongoing since 2012. During this period, Xero removed the original dates from the discussion thread, and to make matters worse, they also deleted the original comments on this new ""Products Idea"" forum. Unfortunately, my comment is missing, so I'm reposting it here.

The issue is that if you do work for a big organisation with hundreds of employees and you are running multiple projects you can't invoice individual people or departments under the same organisation. I know you can add extra contacts but this still doesn't work, as I need the statements generated to ONLY include projects to that relevant team member.

I have resorted to fudging the company name by adding periods in various locations, for example:

Business Name PM Pty Ltd
Business Name PM Pty Ltd.
Business Name PM Pty. Ltd
Business Name PM Pty. Ltd.
Business Name PM. Pty Ltd
Business Name PM. Pty Ltd.
Business Name PM. Pty. Ltd.
Business Name. PM Pty Ltd

we deal with explosives which have a gross weight and explosive content weight that we need to give our customers and infomation like CE number etc

we currently use sage 50 accounts and was looking to move as xero does seem user friendly, but the most important thing was your mobile app, which Sage doesn't do unfortunately, but looks like were going to have to stay there as the reports are full customization and i can have all the information needed for our products and customers",1

"I contacted Support about this issue on the first day it changed over - we have over 100 entities we oversee and losing this feature has essentially doubled our workload. This is the response I got - pretty much saying I should lodge to ""add this as a feature we would like to see"" I shouldn't have to ask for a feature you already had.

From your query, it sounds like you would like to be able to access the Xero Network feature from within the invoice itself, like in Classic Invoicing.


This is a request that's already been raised with us and I've found an idea that's similar to what you’re suggesting in our Xero Product Ideas.

"@Ross Persson and if you use Tab forwards then Tab back to get to be able to type in the contact (because being able to do everything with the keyboard is an Accessibility thing) it works, but you can't Tab to delete what's already written because pressing space with the delete highlighted brings up the contact details (pressing enter works, but which out of space and enter mean 'do the thing' is pretty inconsistent throughout the program).

We have many customers with more than 2 addresses, as below

1) Shop address
2) warehouse address
3) Billing address

However we are only able to add 2 addresses to the Contact Details page, which means valuable information is missing from their Contact records.

Can you please add an extra address field into the Contact Details Section?",3

"This was probably the main reason why I kept using classic invoicing instead of moving to new invoicing. It was just to difficult to review draft invoices when I couldn't see the full account names. It's been many months since this significant user issue was raised, and many months since Xero advised 'working on it'. Is there any timeframe yet when this basic functionality will be reinstated?",1
Excellent.,3
This is helpful. We can finally differentiate between the billing address and the site location on the quote.,3
"It's absurd that this hasn't been implemented in OVER a year!  Off the top of my head, there are at least 3 different user interfaces for date fields and the same for the account field.

When entering a payment on an invoice, it is maddening having to type an amount, mouse-click the date, mouse-click the account, and then type a reference.  I cannot begin to describe how slow this feels or how much of a workflow impedance it is.

I don't understand why the date field behaviour and list selection behaviour are not defined re-useable components and therefore exactly the same EVERYWHERE that type of field appears.  It appears that whoever codes a feature is re-inventing the UI instead of using a single set of common components.

Come on, Xero, get it together!  It is an absolutely HORRIBLE user experience that is becoming more and more expected as the norm in Xero - Beautiful by design (my).

"The comments from Geoff and Paul certainly resonate with me. The reason for having the ability to ""un-void"" or re-instate a voided invoice is simply to allow for error. Whether this be human error or system error it is important for us that an invoice that has been issued to a customer and is then voided by accident can be re-instated. It does not make sense that any acton cannot be undone when an error is made.

Similarly, if an invoice is created in error, the ability to void it and then re-use the invoice number is important when using sequential invoice numbers across different systems.",1
"I’d like to request the addition of a ""Unit of Measurement (UOM)"" column in the Invoice module. This feature is essential for businesses that sell goods or services in varying units such as kilograms, liters, meters, boxes, hours, etc.

Currently, we have to manually include the UOM in the item description, which:
- Reduces clarity and consistency across invoices
- Makes reporting and inventory tracking more difficult
- Increases the risk of human error

Suggested Implementation:
- Add a dedicated UOM field in the Products and Services setup
- Display the UOM column in invoices, quotes, and bills
- Allow customization of UOMs (e.g., kg, m², pcs, hrs) per item

Benefits:
- Improved invoice clarity and professionalism
- Better support for inventory-based businesses
- Enhanced integration with third-party apps and reporting tools

This feature would be a valuable enhancement for many users across industries. Thank you for considering this request!",3
"@graham @sally @everyone

They have no interest. Sorry to disappoint.

Some bean counter has worked out that the churn rate for disgruntled clients will be less than the new customers they attract with their sh*t adverts on TV here in the UK.

In 2023 there were 5,510,265 businesses of 0-49 emplyees - their target market. So there is an awfully big pool of people that will sign up and think all works fine for a few months.

For anyone interested - the transcript of my e-mail is below

This is not customer service - it's rudeness.

--------8<------
May I take the opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment and thank you for your introductory e-mail, which has arrived at a particularly opportune moment as I have become increasingly frustrated with the lack of feedback and basic customer service from Xero over recent months. 
Writing comments and suggestions via Xero Central seems to be like shouting into a void. One particular issue that has been ongoing for almost a year now concerns the facility (or rather the current lack of it) for multiple delivery addresses to be stored for each contact, a facility supported now by over 400 of your clients. If you look at the timeline, there has been only one response from Xero (in September 2022) in which we were all told by Kelly Munro that Xero were working hard behind the scenes…. but nothing since. Having posted to the forum again in January and still not received a reply, I took to Twitter as follows:    
  @Xero
still no update on multiple delivery address capability - ongoing for a year. 400 of your users have told you this is crucial, but no comment from Xero since 11 Sep 2022. Ignoring your customers is never a good idea.

Thanks for the prompt and feedback. We're not ignoring you ... there is no further update. Per the post from us in September, we're undertaking work behind the scenes which will allow us to more easily add new features and ideas like this. ^OG

From a customer’s point of view, these replies are somewhat condescending and patronising. It is unacceptable to be “kept in the dark” in this way with no timescale for Beta testing or implementation mentioned. To be told that “it’s complicated and we are working on it” is just not good enough.  I believe that we are entitled to expect better.

"We are often looking to produce progress payment invoices based off the total quoted/accepted amount. Each progress payment invoice should then detail any amounts received against the total amount, as well as invoicing for the next amount due and in effect, give a running balance. Seems crazy that this is not something Xero have considered. Please product team, investigate this option as I'm sure plenty of people would benefit from this feature.",1
This is a critical change to ensure that clients do not use the same file for different entities.,2
"A word tothe XERO team.
This is madness.
Whilst you continue to invest in useless updates, you ignore such basic needs.  This is a very simple update for you guys with less regression testing required than you woudl need for many of the useless changes you have made recently.

Purely because of this issue, XERO is of no use to us in most applications.

There is an obvious missunderstanding by those wiuthin XERO as to how important this feature is...not just because people like it but ecause some products HAVE to be quoted like this and invoiced like this.

At teh earliest opportunity, we shall be migrating our busines to another system.  We also always recommend people DO NOT use XERO now as it is proven that some most basic features are not in place.

Of course, XERO know how difficult it is for a business to migrate and take advantage of this through subscription changes, feature dilution, etc etc.  They will put up with customers not getting basic features as long as customers still pay.

This WILL change XERO.  You will lose customers as word of mouth changes from 'its a great system' to avoid XERO, they dont offer basic features and dont respond to customers needs'

I learned of XERO through a very large global group of fast growing businesses that I am part of.  This group is backed by one of the worlds largest and most influential global companies.  XERO was the defacto choice for many and recommended to nearly all.
I can tell you now that it is already changing.   Many now recommend your competitors who have a more complete solution, have moved forward faster and are better value.",0
